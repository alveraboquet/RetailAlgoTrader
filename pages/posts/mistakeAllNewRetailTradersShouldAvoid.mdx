Here at RetailAlgoTrader we see the same mistake over and over again from beginner traders.

_"I just came into a large sum of money. How can I make this money work for me?"_

_"Hey I have been working for a few years now and have a bunch of money saved up. I want to start learning how to trade."_

_"The markets just crashed and I don't want to miss my opportunity."_

What do all of these people have in common?

They waited way too long to learn how to trade.

Now they have money and are rushing to get into the markets. They begin trading with no idea what they are doing and end up
losing their money.

Continue reading below to discover how to avoid this common pitfall.

## Start learning how to trade BEFORE you have any money

Would you start operating on patients before spending a decade in college and med school?

Would you start flying planes before spending years in a flight simulator?

Absolutely not. Surgery and piloting planes are highly technical and difficult skills that require years of practice.
Trading is no different.

So why would you wait until you have a ton of trading capital before you start to learn how to trade?

For some reason people believe they can just hop into the markets with zero training and just print money. Unfortunately,
that is not how it works.

## Trading is a skill

Trading is a skill just like anything else. To become proficient at a skill requires practice. Lots of practice using
correct techniques. Excluding the meme stocks of 2020 and 2021 you cannot just randomly buy and sell assets and hope to
become financially independent.

_Perfect practice makes perfect._

This is a major issue that many new traders got caught up in once the markets cooled off after the insanity of 2020 and 2021.
It was impossible to not make money in the markets the past two years.

One of the largest drops straight into a massive bull run. Not to mention the meme stock frenzy.

These novice traders had been trading their life savings and making a boatload of money. Quite a few quit their day jobs
determined to become full-time day traders.

But then the market cooled off.

And these traders lost big.

They very quickly discovered a couple of facts that led to this downfall.

- They had no real trading strategy other than scrolling through Reddit threads
- They had not backtested or optimized their strategies
- They had no risk management strategy
- They had no position sizing strategy

They did not actually understand how to trade. And this cost them.

A proper trader can make money in bull markets, flat markets, or bear markets. They have an arsenal of tested strategies for a
variety of market conditions. These are traders who treat trading as a job.

They spend time developing strategies, thoroughly testing these strategies, analyzing trades, etc.

Trading requires lots of time and effort to truly master. If you try to jump into the markets without spending the time to
learn what you are doing you will get burnt.

## Temptations of large trading capital

Waiting to learn how to trade until you have money saved up is a very dangerous situation. Money just sitting in the bank is
almost worthless. You need to use your money to generate more money.

However, you need to develop a plan and skillset before you have a bunch of money saved up.

An issue arises when people with significant savings decide they want to get into trading. They may spend a couple of days
reading about technical analysis and different types of orders and then dump $50,000 into a trading account.

They begin trading with this money but they still have no idea what they are doing.

Hopefully, they only lose 20% or so before they decide to stop trading. At worst they blow up their account and lose everything.

You would be astonished by the amount of people that lose most or all of their trading capital and THEN decide to learn how to
properly trade.

This is one of the primary reasons that people describe trading as a “scam” or “basically gambling”.

They tried to trade without spending the proper time and energy learning and lost their money. Instead of acknowledging their
mistake it is easier for them to just label trading as nonsense.

Make your mistakes now while you do not have any money to lose. Spend time learning and training so when you actually start
making money you are ready to utilize your savings to accelerate to financial freedom.

If you already have significant savings and are looking to get into trading, by all means go for it. But you need to learn what
you are doing before you put real money into a trading account.

## Solution

Start by learning how to trade.

Technical analysis, fundamental analysis, risk management, different markets, backtesting, and how to develop a comprehensive
trading system are all essential skills.

If you would like to see a comprehensive summary of how to become a market-ready trader we will be releasing a roadmap to
profitability shortly.
