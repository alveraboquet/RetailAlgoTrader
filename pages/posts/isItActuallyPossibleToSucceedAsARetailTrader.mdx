## **You can absolutely become a profitable retail algorithmic trader**

First and foremost, it is absolutely possible to succeed. There is an entire population of individual day traders and
algorithmic traders with proven track records.

So clearly it is possible.

Many people spread the myth that trading is just gambling and you will lose all of your money. This is simply untrue.

The majority of people spreading this message spent a couple of months attempting to trade thinking it was a get rich quick
scheme.

And when it didn't immediately make them wealthy they decided it was all a bunch of nonsense. It is easier for them to believe
that then to acknowledge that they simply are not willing to put in the time and effort to succeed in this industry.

Trading is a simple game of long-term probabilities. Take the example below.

If you were to start out with $50,000 in trading capital and only made 1% a week you would have nearly $350,000 after 4 years.

That's a 600% return over four years or an annual average return of 150%. That's at only 1% a week which is very doable.

Many traders can consistently make 3-4% a week.

That being said trading is an extremely difficult profession to succeed in. There are a couple of reasons for this.

## No formal education

Most likely you have spent the first 20 or so years of your life in some form of education. Everything you learned in those
first 20 years is useless when it comes to trading. Except perhaps a little bit of math.

If you want to learn how to trade you will have to spend your time and energy teaching yourself. This is a difficult and
length process.

That is why RetailAlgoTrader was created. To provide all the education materials you need in one place.

## Psychology

Many people cannot succeed at trading due to the immense psychological aspects of this profession.

You must understand that you will lose money.

You will lose trades.

In fact some of the most successful strategies only have a 51% or 52% success rate. Nearly half of their trades are losers.

For example, below is a strategy that makes 10,000 trades at a 51% win rate.

<figure className="postTable">

| Initial Capital                             | $100,000   |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| # of Winning Trades                         | 5,100      |
| # of Losing Trades                          | 4,900      |
| Gross Profits (1% return per winning trade) | $5,100,000 |
| Gross Losses (1% loss per losing trade)     | $4,900,000 |
| Total Net Profit                            | $200,000   |

Some strategies only have a 25% win rate. But their winners are much larger than their losers.

For example, below is a strategy that only has a win rate of 25% but the winning trades make 3.5% while the losing trades only make 1%.

This trader was able to lose 3/4s of his trades and still make a hefty profit.

<figure className="postTable">

| Initial Capital                             | $100,000 |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| # of Winning Trades                         | 250      |
| # of Losing Trades                          | 750      |
| Gross Profits (1% return per winning trade) | $875,000 |
| Gross Losses (1% loss per losing trade)     | $750,000 |
| Total Net Profit                            | $125,000 |

The key is ensuring that you make money over the long term. Many people just cannot handle these losing trades. They panic
and abandon their trading plans. They begin trading on gut instinct and pretty soon they have blown up their account.

As opposed to the majority of professions, you can do everything right with trading and still lose. A lot of people cannot
stand this fact.

If you do not have good control of your trading psychology losing trades are absolutely devastating while winning trades are
just moderately satisfying.

## No accountability

With trading you have no boss. You have no timesheets. You have no team members.

School, jobs, and families all have structures and people whose entire purpose revolves around holding you accountable to your
responsibilities.

None of this exists when you are trading. It is completely up to you to stay disciplined day after day. This is difficult for
many people.

## Very little consistency

The majority of the population is addicted to a guaranteed bi-weekly check.

_"Okay if I show up and sit here for 40-50 hours a week and do enough to not get fired I will receive this amount of income."_

For many people this is like a morphine drip. They become used to it and are unable to live without it.

They crave that low-effort consistency.

However with trading, there is absolutely no consistency. There could be a month where you make $15,000 and then the next month
you could lose $7,000.

If you are trading correctly you will know that in the long-term your strategy is profitable. But many people cannot handle the
inconcistency.

## Becoming a successful trader

This lifestyle appeals to many as it offers freedom from the 9-5 lifestyle and theoretically unlimited earning potential.

The better you trade the more money you make which is vastly different from working for somebody else.

So how can a retail trader compete against hedge funds and market makers?

In some ways it is easier for a retail trader to extract money from the markets. This topic will be discussed in more detail
in future lessons.

But for now just understand that retail traders are like nimble squirrels darting in and out of the market to collect small
profits.

Hedge funds trade such large balances and have to adhere to a multitude of regulations that this actually greatly hinders
their possible return.

If you spend the time and energy to truly understand the markets and how you can extract some profit then it is completely
possible to be a successful retail trader.
