There is a lot of confusion and inaccurate beliefs around market makers and their roles in the market. This article aims to establish the role of market makers at a foundational level.

## What are market makers and how do they work?

Market makers are the entities that have largely made trading available to retail traders. When you buy or sell an asset, the order is almost certainly being routed through a market maker. Market makers have a massive inventory of assets.

For each asset they provide a bid price (the price to sell an instrument) and an ask price (the price to buy an instrument).
These are the prices you see on your trading platforms.

In the example above, Tesla's bid price is $799.52 while the ask price is $800.95. The market maker is offering to buy TSLA
shares at $799.52 and sell TSLA shares at $800.95.

When you purchase a certain volume of an asset, the market maker takes that asset from their inventory and transfers ownership to
you.

Prices set by the market maker are non-negotiable. If you believe that the price of TSLA stock is way too high the market maker does not care. You can either buy at their quoted price or wait for what you believe to be a fair price.

The benefit of this system (and it is a huge benefit) is that you know for certain that the market maker is willing to buy or sell at anytime. There is not the risk that you will be unable to find a buyer or a seller for your asset.

Market makes provide immense liquidity in a market. This is why anytime the market is open you can submit orders and be confident they will be fulfilled at the correct price.

Before market makers, buyers would have to be matched up with sellers and vice versa. This was a much more difficult process and one of the reasons that trading was not open to retail investors.

Market makers make money on the bid-ask spread. Let's take another look at that example from earlier. Bid price of $799.52 and ask price of $800.95.

The difference between the ask price and the bid price is the spread ($1.43 in this example). So they make a profit of $1.43 for every share of TSLA they trade. This may not seem like a lot but when you consider the immense volume of TSLA it adds up very quickly.

## Are market makers regulated?

Market makers are highly regulated by the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange commission (SEC)</a> and <a href="https://www.finra.org/#/">Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)</a>. They must continuously provide fair and accurate prices for any and all instruments they have agreed to act as market makers for.

Some exchanges use a network of market makers that compete to set the bid and ask prices. Other exchanges, such as the New York Stock exchange, use a single market maker that sets a fair bid and ask price.

Market makers can take a couple different forms:

- They may be an individual firm that partners with one or more brokerages
- Your broker may have its own market maker entity to facilitate trading
- There are even individuals that act as market makers depending on the market

Most market makers are very large institutions as the infrastructure cost and required volume of assets to be held is very large.

## Risks of acting as a market maker

The primary risk in acting as a market maker is that they are required to hold a large quantity of assets in their inventory. For an illiquid asset with low trading volume, it is possible the price of the security significantly drops before they can sell the shares to a trader.

Now they are buying high and selling low which will result in losses. This is why market makers charge a fee or a spread. They need to cover this risk.

This risk is why you will see the spread of an asset constantly changing. If an asset has a low trading volume or is very volatile this is a risky asset for the market maker to hold. Therefore they will increase the spread.

This has two objectives:

- Financially offset their increased risk in holding these assets
- Discourage trading of the asset. Traders dislike a large spread. So as the spread widens trading slows down which decreases the volatility of the asset

Market makers also use more advanced techniques of managing risk such as hedging with options or futures.

The goal of a market maker is to be market neutral. They exist solely to provide liquidity and are not directional players in the market.

Market makers ensure smooth and efficient operation of the markets. Without them retail trading would not be possible.
