## What is Pinescript?

Pinescript is TradingView's proprietary coding language. It is a lightweight language designed to allow quick and easy creation
of strategies and indicators within TradingView's trading platform.

A huge advantage of Pinescript is you can then backtest your strategies using TradingView's data pipeline. This saves significant
time and energy over coding your own backtesting engine in Python or something similar. The downside of this is that you are
limited to TradingView's platform, assets, and data.

While TradingView has the vast majority of assets you could wish to trade it is still possible to run into issues where
you they do not have the necessary asset or data.

Another downside is that Pinescript is cloud-based. This means TradingView places limits on how much data and resources your
program can use. This is why Pinescript is ideal for custom indicators or simple strategies.

If you are interested in creating a complex strategy that requires significant data for analysis and backtesting you are better
off with an option such as Quantconnect or Python.

Pinescript allows you to create three different trading tools:

1. Indicators
2. Strategies (Full algorithms that can submit orders and undergo backtesting)
3. Libraries (This is more advanced and will not be discuss)

We will spend half of this guide looking at Pinescript indicators and the other half looking at Pinescript strategies.

## Goals of this guide

- Understand how to read and write Pinescript
- Discover how to backtest using Pinescript
- Explore Pinescript ecosystem
- Create own indicator
- Develop own trading strategy and backtest it

## TradingView Indicators

TradingView scripts are the name of indicators and strategies coded using Pinescript. If you have spent any time in TradingView
you have almost certainly used some of their built-in indicators.

The vast majority of these indicators are coded using Pinescript. By understanding Pinescript you can evaluate and adjust the
inner workings of these indicators to fine-tune your strategy.

### Taking a look at the Bollinger Band indicator

As we go through this guide we encourage you to follow-along. This will ensure maximum retention of the content and best
prepare you to create your own scripts.

#### Opening Bollinger Band script source code

Below we have opened a daily chart of Microsoft (MSFT).

<figure>
  <Image
    src="/images/posts/pinescriptGuide/MSFTBlank.webp"
    height={2160}
    width={3840}
    alt=""
  />
  <figcaption>Blank MSFT chart</figcaption>
</figure>

At the top click on `Indicators` and type `Bollinger Bands`. A couple of options will pop up separated by Technicals and
Community Scripts (these are scripts created by individual traders such as yourself). Click on the plain `Bollinger Bands`
under technicals.

<figure>
  <Image
    src="/images/posts/pinescriptGuide/MSFTBBands.webp"
    height={2160}
    width={3840}
    alt=""
  />
  <figcaption>MSFT chart with Bollinger Bands</figcaption>
</figure>

You should now see the Bollinger Bands showing on your chart. (If you are unfamiliar with bollinger bands you can read up on
them [here](investopedia.com/terms/b/bollingerbands.asp). From here click on the three dots on the indicator line in the top
left.

Then click `Source code...` and you should see the Pinescript code for the Bollinger Bands indicator pop up at the
bottom under `Pine Editor`.

  <figcaption>Opening Pine Editor</figcaption>
</figure>

The Pine Editor is where you will write your indicators and strategies. If you have previous coding experience Pine Editor
is not as advanced as some of the code editors out there such as VSCode and PyCharm. However it has a couple of key advantages
specific to Pinescript:

- Pinescript syntax highlighting
- Syntax reminders for built-in functions
- cmd + click on keywords opens the Pine Reference Manual
- cmd + space activates auto-complete

Due to these built-in advantages of the Pine Editor we recommend writing Pinescript code in the Pine Editor rather than a
third-party code editor.

#### Evaluating the Bollinger Band indicator code

// creates comments in Pinescript. We have added comments to the Bollinger Band source code below to explain what each line
means. The comments are in black and the source code is in red.

<div className={styles.code}>

```
//This is simply a comment indicating to TradingView and the user which
//version of PineScript is being used.
//@version=5

//Sets the default values for the indicator. These can be changed from the
//indicator menu in TradingView.
//title establishes this will be a an indicator called Bollinger Bands.
//Overlay=true means the indicator will be overlaid on the chart.
//timeframe="" means the indicator will inherit its' timeframe from the
//chart. This is usually what you will use.
//timeframe_gaps is a little complicated. Basically it is used when the
//data on the chart and the data used by the indicator are different. This
//is not very common so we will not worry about this but know that true is
//the default.
indicator(shorttitle="BB", title="Bollinger Bands", overlay=true, timeframe="", timeframe_gaps=true)

//the input function will add an adjustable input for the user. In
//TradingView if you double click on the Bollinger Bands a menu will
//popup. You will notice there are options to change that correspond to
//the following lines

//creates a length input that will be used to generate the SMA that is at
//the center of the Bollinger Bands. .int tells TradingView that the input
//will be an integer. minval=1 tells TradingView an input less than 1 is
//not allowed.
length = input.int(20, minval=1)

//creates a src input that will also be used to generate the SMA. This
//indicator will use the close prices to calculate the SMA and will be
//called Source on the pop-up menu.
src = input(close, title="Source")

//creates the standard deviation input that will be used for the upper and
//lower bands. .float indicates the number can be a decimal. It will have
//a default value of 2.0 with a minimum allowed value of 0.001 and a
//maximum allowed value of 50. It will be called StdDev on the pop-up
//menu.
//NOTE: minval, maxval, and title are all standard options for float
//inputs. Using ctrl+click on input in Pine Editor you can see the other standard options.
mult = input.float(2.0, minval=0.001, maxval=50, title="StdDev")

//uses the built in SMA indicator from TradingView to generate a SMA using
//the src and length inputs we defined above. If you ctrl+click on ta.sma
//in Pine Editor you will see in the documentation that the required
//inputs for the TradingView SMA are source and length.
//NOTE: Anytime you see ta.something in Pinescript that indicates it is a
//built-in indicator. Using ctrl+click you will be able to pull up the
//documentation and see how to properly use it.
basis = ta.sma(src, length)

//uses the built-in standard deviation indicator. ta.stdev defaults to 1
//standard deviation but we want 2 standard deviations for the bollinger
//bands. So we multiply ta.stdev by mult which we defined as 2.0 above.
dev = mult \* ta.stdev(src, length)

//creates the upper band. Takes the SMA created above and adds the
//calculated standard deviation from above.
upper = basis + dev

//creates the lower band. Takes the SMA created above and subtracts the
//calculated standard deviation from above.
lower = basis - dev

//creates the offset input for the Bollinger Bands. A positive offset will
//shift the Bollinger Bands to the right. A negative offset will shift the
//the Bollinger Bands to the left. Offsetting your indicators is rarely
//useful. This is why the default is an integer of 0.
offset = input.int(0, "Offset", minval = -500, maxval = 500)

//the plot function is used to add some generated values to the chart.
//it takes the calculated value, the desired name, default color, and
//offset.

//this plot function takes our SMA created above and adds it to the chart.
plot(basis, "Basis", color=#FF6D00, offset = offset)

//this plot function takes our upper band created above and adds it to the
//chart.
p1 = plot(upper, "Upper", color=#2962FF, offset = offset)

//this plot function takes our lower band created above and adds it to the
//chart.
p2 = plot(lower, "Lower", color=#2962FF, offset = offset)

//the fill function will shade in the area between two lines. In this case
//it fills in the space between the upper band and lower band, gives it a name of background, and provides a default color.
fill(p1, p2, title = "Background", color=color.rgb(33, 150, 243, 95))
```

</div>

That was a lot of information that you were probably not very familiar with. Spend some time reviewing the source code, our
comments, and the documentation with ctrl+click.

If you are able to understand how all these lines of code relate then you know enough to stumble your way through most Pinescript.

### Creating our own custom indicator

Before diving into creating your own indicator be sure to check TradingView's built-in indicators as well as the community
indicators. Somebody may have already created what you are looking for.

Start by clicking on Pine Editor at the bottom of your screen. This should open up an Untitled script with the following lines
of code:

<div className={styles.code}>

```
// This source code is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License 2.0 at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/
// © YourUsername

//@version=5
indicator("My script")
plot(close)
```

</div>

We will be creating the RSI oscillator line by line to see what creating our own indicator would look like. If you are
unfamiliar with RSI or need a refresher check out this [article](investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp) from Investopedia.

First you need to give the indicator a name and some default values. If you are unsure what arguments indicator takes you can
ctrl+click on `indicator` in the Pine Editor to open the interactive reference manual.

<div className={styles.code}>

```
// This source code is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License 2.0 at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/
// © YourUsername

//@version=5
indicator(title="Relative Strength Index", shorttitle="RSI", format=format.price, precision=2, timeframe="", timeframe_gaps=true)
plot(close)
```

</div>

RSI has two lines. The RSI line and the MA line. We will give the user six options to choose for their MA line.

<div className={styles.code}>

```
// This source code is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License 2.0 at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/
// © YourUsername

//@version=5
indicator(title="Relative Strength Index", shorttitle="RSI", format=format.price, precision=2, timeframe="", timeframe_gaps=true)
plot(close)


ma(source, length, type) =>
    switch type
        "SMA" => ta.sma(source, length)
        "Bollinger Bands" => ta.sma(source, length)
        "EMA" => ta.ema(source, length)
        "SMMA (RMA)" => ta.rma(source, length)
        "WMA" => ta.wma(source, length)
        "VWMA" => ta.vwma(source, length)
```

</div>

### Taking a look at an existing TradingView strategy

By clicking on `Indicator` then `Technicals` and then filtering to `strategies` you can see many built-in strategies. These
are strategies based upon technical indicators and are typically fairly basic.

However, that does not mean they are not effective and they also serve as a great starting point for your own strategy.

<figure>
  <Image
    src="/images/posts/pinescriptGuide/SelectingStrategy.webp"
    height={2160}
    width={3840}
    alt=""
  />
  <figcaption className="text-secondary">Opening Pine Editor</figcaption>
</figure>

Go ahead and select the `MovingAvg Cross` strategy. The Strategy Tester tab should automatically open up. The Strategy Tester
tab has three tabs: Overview, Performance Summary, List of Trades.

#### Overview

The overview tab shows a big-picture summary of the strategy's performance. When you load a strategy onto a chart
TradingView will automatically backtest that strategy on whatever chart you have open.

For example, we have the daily MSFT chart open so TradingView testing the MovingAvg Cross strategy on this chart all the way
back to 1986.

<figure>
  <Image
    src="/images/posts/pinescriptGuide/StrategyTester.webp"
    height={2160}
    width={3840}
    alt=""
  />
  <figcaption className="text-secondary">
    Overview tab of Strategy Tester
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Overview will display the following metrics for you:

- Net Profit: Gross Profit - Gross Loss
- Total Closed Trades: Total number of trades taken by the strategy
- Percent Profitable: Percentage of trades that were profitable
- Profit Factor: Gross profit divided by gross loss
- Max Drawdown: Max loss from the peak of the strategy to the bottom of the strategy
- Avg Trade: Return of all trades averaged out
- Avg # Bars in Trades: How long a trade was held averaged out

You will also notice the red and blue chart. This chart displays a comparison of your equity (how much money you would have
if you closed out of all of your open trades) vs your drawdown (Max equity - current equity).

On the left axis is the account equity and on the right axis is the drawdown. As the account equity (blue area) increases,
the drawdown (red area) will decrease. Vice versa as the account equity (blue area) decreases the drawdown (red area) will
increase.

Looking at our example strategy you can see that for the first 1000 trades the strategy started out well. The
account equity increased while the drawdown stayed at 0. However, after 1000 trades the strategy began to perform poorly.

As the account equity decreases the drawdown increases proportionally until the final account equity of $999,900.98 and final
drawdown of $185.13.

#### Performance summary

This tab holds in-depth statistics of the strategy. After testing a strategy you will want to evaluate all of these metrics to
get a proper understanding of your strategy's performance. If you are unfamiliar with some of these metrics check out this
[article](tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000561856-how-are-strategy-tester-report-values-calculated-and-what-do-they-mean/)
from TradingView.

You will also see three icons in the top left of Strategy Tester next to the name of the strategy. These are a gear, an alarm
clock, and a download button. We will discuss the gear and alarm clock shortly. The download button can be used to download
the performance summary to a .csv file if you have a premium plan.

  </figcaption>
</figure>

#### List of trades

This tab lists every single trade that the strategy took while undergoing backtesting. It includes the following information:

- Type of order
- Trading signal
- Date the trade was opened
- Price the trade was opened at
- Number of contracts traded
- Profit of the trade
- Cumulative profit
- Run-up (how much profit you would have made if you had sold at the price peak while your trade was open)
- Drawdown

    width={3840}
    alt=""
  />
  <figcaption className="text-secondary">
    List of trades from Strategy Tester
  </figcaption>
</figure>

This tab has two major purposes:

1. It allows you to pick random trades from your test history and validate that your trading strategy is working as intended
2. It allows you to download all of the trades in a CSV file that can then be used for in-depth analysis with Excel, Python,
   or something similar

#### Settings

By clicking the gear icon in the top left of the Strategy Tester you can adjust the settings and inputs of the strategy.

##### Inputs

The inputs tab contains two adjustable inputs for the strategy:

###### Length

This is how many bars the indicator takes in when plotting.

###### ConfirmBars

This is how many bars the indicator requires for confirmation before issuing a trading signal. For example, with
the default of 1 then the strategy will issue a trading signal as soon as the moving average crossover occurs.

If we adjust the ConfirmBars input to 3 then the trading signal will wait 3 bars after the moving average crossover before
issuing a trading signal. If the moving average crossover reverts/crosses back the other direction during those 3 bars no
trading signal will be issued.

### Publishing our script to TradingView's community

We will not spend too much time on this topic as it does not directly affect your trading. If you would like to share a strategy
or script with the TradingView community that is certainly an option. Review [TradingView's script publishing rules](tradingview.com/house-rules/?solution=43000590599)
to ensure you do not violate any rules.

## Additional resources

This guide is a great foundation for your Pinescript knowledge. Feel free to use our created indicator and strategy as a
template while developing your own indicators or strategies. However, there is simply too much Pinescript content to cover in
one guide. If you want to learn more or run into issues while developing your own strategies check out the below resources:

- [Pine User Manual:](tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/en/v5/index.html) This contains comprehensive info on Pinescript
- [Pine Reference Manual:](tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/) This specifies what each variable, function, or Pine keyword does
