# Bracket order

Bracket orders are used to automatically place a takeprofit and a stoploss. The takeprofit order and the stoploss order
will be a one-cancels-the-other order. So essentially a bracket order automates the process of opening a
one-cancels-the-other order.

When you open a buy order, a sell limit (take profit) and a sell stop (stoploss) will be automatically opened as well.

When you open a sell order, a buy limit (take profit) and a buy stop (stoploss) will be automatically opened as well.
