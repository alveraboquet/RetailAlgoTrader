# Advanced Order Types

So far in this course we have discussed the most commonly seen order types:

- Market Orders
- Limit Orders
- Stop Orders
- Stoploss Orders
- Takeprofit Orders

With these orders you can build pretty much any strategy. You use a market/limit/stop order to enter your trade. Then you place
a stoploss order and a takeprofit order. Maybe you were trading a news event with a Straddle technique so you had two stop
orders placed. One triggers so you manually cancel the other.

As you can see, these basic order types can be combined in many different ways depending on what is required. However, manually
placing and managing all of these orders is tedious and can quickly become confusing. Just one simple strategy could require
you to place and manage six different orders just for one potential trade. There are two primary solutions to this issue:

1. Algorithmic trading
2. Advanced Order Types

## Algorithmic Trading for Order Management

A huge benefit of algorithmic trading is that you can automate trade management. For example, you might develop an algorithm
for your Bollinger Band mean reversion strategy. You write the algorithm so that when price breaks the lower Bollinger Band
a buy trade is placed.

When the lower Bollinger band is broken, the algorithm places a market buy order at the next candle's open. At the same time
it places a stoploss order below the low of the previous candle and a takeprofit at the moving average at the center of the
Bollinger Band. When the first takeprofit is hit the algorithm is programmed to only sell 1/2 of your position while at the
same time placing a second takeprofit at the upper Bollinger band and moving your stoploss to your entry price.

This strategy has a lot of moving parts. Managing all of these different trades efficiently and correctly would be extremely
difficult even if you stayed glued to your screen 24/7. Automatic trade management is one of the reasons why some many traders
get into algorithmic trading.

As your strategies become more refined and advanced it will become difficult to manage everything by yourself. We discuss
the role of algorithmic trading in order management in depth in our Algorithmic Trading Academy course.

## Advanced Order Types

There is another option if you are not prepared to dive into algorithmic trading yet. Many brokers offer advanced order types
that are combinations of the orders listed above. These advanced orders can be seen below:

- One-cancels-the-other
- Bracket order
- Trailing stop
- Stop limit order

Keep in mind that not all brokers offer all of these order types.
