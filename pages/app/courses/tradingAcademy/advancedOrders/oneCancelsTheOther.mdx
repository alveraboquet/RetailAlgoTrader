# One-cancels-the-other

A one-cancels-the-other order places two different orders specified by you. When one of the orders triggers, the other order
is automatically cancelled. This is ideal for straddle strategies where you are not sure which direction price will move. In
our news straddle trading strategy a one-cancels-the-other order is what we would want to use.

Another common use for this order type is takeprofits and stoplosses. The majority of brokers allow you to set a specific
takeprofit and stoploss order for an open position. If the either the takeprofit or the stoploss is hit the other is automatically
cancelled.

However, some brokers do not offer this functionality. With these brokers you must open a position in a stock and then place
a one-cancels-the-other order for the takeprofit and the stoploss. Let's look at an example.

You issue a buy market order for 5 shares of $TSLA at $700. If price hits $750 you want to sell your position for profit. If price hits
$680 you want to close your position to minimize losses. Unfortunately your broker does not let you set a takeprofit or
stoploss for this order.

So you submit a sell limit order for 5 shares of $TSLA at $750 (your takeprofit order). You submit a separate sell stop order
for 5 shares of $TSLA at $680. Your trade idea was correct and $TSLA rockets up to $750 triggering your sell limit order. Now
you have no shares of $TSLA but because your stoploss was a separate sell stop order it is still open. $TSLA's stock price drops
to $680 and your sell stop order is triggered. Now you are short 5 shares of $TSLA which is not at all your intention.

This happens because you submitted two separate orders. Instead lets see what happens when you submit a one-cancels-the-other
order. One order is a sell limit order for 5 shares of $TSLA at $750. Now if $TSLA's
price breaks $750 5 shares of $TSLA will be sold from your account. The other order is a sell stop order at $680. Now if $TSLA's
price hits $680 5 shares of $TSLA will be sold from your account. $TSLA jumps up to $750 and your 5 shares are sold. In
addition, your sell stop order at $680 is automatically cancelled. This eliminates the issue of accidently shorting 5 shares
that we saw in the first example.

Again, nowadays the majority of brokers allow you to attach specified takeprofits and stoplosses to each trade. So using
one-cancels-the-other as stoplosses and takeprofits is not necessary. However, there is a chance you experience the need
to use one-cancels-the-other as stoplosses and takeprofits.
