# Stop limit order

Stop limit orders combine the best of stop orders with the best of limit orders. Remember that a stop order triggers as soon
as the set price threshold is reached. So if your buy stop order is set at $280 and price hits $280 then a buy order will
be submitted. Typically this order will be filled right at $280 or within plus or minus $1. However, theoretically with a stop
order the order could be filled at any price. If price is moving quickly and there is low liquidity your buy order might trigger
at $280 but is not actually fulfilled until $295.

A limit order does not allow transactions to occur above or below a set threshold. A buy limit order at $285 means your buy
order will only be submitted if it can be fulfilled at less than $285.

A stop limit order allows you to define a range where you want to allow your order to be fulfilled. The stop order portion of
the stop limit order will establish that no trades should be opened until price breaks $280. The limit order portion of the
stop limit order will establish that no trades should be opened if they cannot be fulfilled at less than $285. With this stop
limit order you have established a range of $280-$285 where your buy order can be fulfilled.

Stop limit orders at fantastic at ensuring a certain entry price for your order. One of the primary risks that stop limit
orders negate is price gapping up or down. Price gaps up or down when there is a major price jump between trading sessions.
This is typically due to a news event that occurred overnight.

In our previous example if you had placed a buy stop order at $280 on Monday afternoon
but Tuesday morning price gaps up to $310 then your trade will be fulfilled at $310. Instead if you use a stop limit order
the trade will not be fulfilled since it has exceeded the limit order of $285.
