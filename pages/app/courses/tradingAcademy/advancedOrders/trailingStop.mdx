# Trailing stop

A trailing stop is a very useful stop loss order. Trailing stop orders automatically move your stoploss order to track
the price of the asset. This is very effective at maximizing returns from a trade as it ensures you do not exit your trade
too early. As long as price continues upward, your stoploss will follow it.

Trailing stops are extremely useful to implement once your trade is already profitable. For example, you issue a buy order
believing that $AAPL will rise and as an intelligent trader you set a stoploss just in case you are wrong. Well you were
right and price rises substantially. At this point you have a couple of options:

1. Close your trade to secure profit
2. Move your stoploss to your entry price to ensure you do not take a loss on this trade if it reverses
3. Set a trailing stop loss

If you close your trade for profit now you may be losing out on a lot of potential profit. If you just move your stoploss to
your entry price you may end up with no profit. However, if you use a trailing stop loss you can maximize your potential gains
as your stoploss will automatically follow behind price as it continues to rise.

## Trailing stop example

Trailing stops track the high water mark of price. Let's say that you submit a buy order for $AAPL at $320. You set your trailing
stop at $10. Your initial stop loss is at $310. Price rises to $330 so your stoploss rises to $320. Price rises to $345 so your
stop loss rises to $335. Price drops to $340 but your stop loss stays at $335. Price rises to $350 so your stop loss rises
to $340. Finally price drops to $340 and your order is closed out.

## How to set trailing distance of a trailing stop

Determining how far behind to set your trailing stop behind price is very difficult. It will depend heavily on strategy.
If you trading a short-term strategy you probably want your trailing stop to follow closer behind. If you are trading a long-term
strategy you probably want your trailing stop to follow further behind. This will give your trade more to breathe and play out.

If your trailing stop is set too close to price then your trade will not have enough room to breathe and it will be closed out
before it truly has a chance to make a profit. Keep in mind that trades frequently oscillate up and down (known as noise)
before continuing towards your take profit. You need to ensure that your trailing stop allows enough noise.

If your trailing stop is set too far from the price then you will sacrifice significant profits before your trade is closed out.
Trailing stops always follow the high water mark of price. As a result, you will always sacrifice some profits from the peak
before your order is closed out. This is not much of an issue because it is almost impossible to accurately predict the peak
anyways.

One of the common ways to set the trailing distance is through the use of Average True Range (ATR). By making the trailing stop
distance a function of ATR the trailing stop distance will adjust to market volatility.

Regardless of what method you use to set your trailing distance, you need to heavily backtest in order to ensure that it is:

1. Far enough away to allow trades to breathe
2. Close enough that you do not sacrifice an unnecessary amount of profit
