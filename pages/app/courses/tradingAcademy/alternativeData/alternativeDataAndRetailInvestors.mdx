# How can Retail Traders make use of Alternative Data?

To be frank making use of alternative data as a retail investor is extremely difficult for a number of reasons:

1. Purchasing useful datasets is very expensive
2. Creating infrastructure to gather own data is very resource intensive and not a sure success
3. Cleaning and organizing data requires strong statistics and programming skills
4. Manipulating the data into useful insights requires deep knowledge of data science

For your average retail investor these obstacles are simply too difficult to overcome. The majority of traders
would be better focused on technical or fundamental analysis at this time. Most investment firm and fund managers are just
know starting to realize the power of alternative data. This (MarkeWatch article)[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-explosion-of-alternative-data-gives-regular-investors-access-to-tools-previously-employed-only-by-hedge-funds-2019-09-05]
emphasizes how most financial institutions are just know starting to explore the possibilities of alternative data. So to
expect yourself as a retail trader to learn and master alternative data trading is unrealistic.

That being said it is still important to understand the alternative data industry. Over the next decade we will see a
mass adoption of alternative data platforms and trading techniques. Spend the time between now and then understanding
the opportunities and challenges of alternative data. This will allow you to fully take advantage of alternative data
techniques once they become more economical for retail traders.

If you are a more advanced trader interested in testing out alternative data trading then some of the strategies we
mentioned earlier are a great opportunity. Google trends and web-scrapping are both very possible strategies to take
advantage of as a retail trader.
