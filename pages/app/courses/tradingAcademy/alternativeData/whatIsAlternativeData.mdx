# What is Alternative Data?

Alternative data is a less well-known category of trading. It focuses on the use of datasets that are either private
or not widely available. With technical analysis price action
data is accessible by all traders. With fundamental analysis economic reports and company financials are available to the
public. With alternative data the datasets used to make trading decisions are not publicly available.

Major algorithmic trading firms such as Citadel and Two Sigma generate their own datasets for the purpose of trading. By
doing so they aim to give themselves an edge over their competitors in the market.

Creating these datasets typically takes two forms:

1. Unique datasets that are gathered and created by the hedge fund trading them
2. Datasets gathered by third-parties that can then be purchased

These trading firms employ massive teams of data scientists and programmers whose sole job is not to trade but rather
to gather and organize data. The number of programmers at these trading firms who actually get to trade the markets
is fairly small.

In recent years consumers have begun to realize that companies are collecting all of their data and then selling it to
the highest bidder. Well trading firms are frequently the higher bidder. They can use the data from millions of consumers
to fuel their trading decisions.

## Examples of Alternative Data Strategies

These are just a couple of the possible methods used by alogrithmic trading firms that are also possible to use by
retail traders.

### Google Search Data

It is now widely-known that Google's primary product they are selling is their users. They collect any data about their
users they possibly can, package it up, and sell it. While this certainly is the cause of many privacy concerns, as a trader
this presents an opportunity.

Using (Google Trends)[https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US] people can see the most popular search terms all across
the world. With this data you can see which companies or products are trending.

For example on this day we can see that Nvidia stock is one of the top searches in Google. When clicked on it pulls up some
news articles about the poor Nvidia Earnings report. In addition you can see interest over time, interest by subregion,
related topics, and related queries. All of this data can be downloaded and manipulated as you see fit.

By itself this data on Nvidia might not be too useful. However, by downloading and combining multiple datasets you can
give yourself an edge.

This is one of the most basic methods to using Google's data to form trading decisions. Most of Google's datasets are not
publicly available. As a retail trader we will not have the resources to afford or make use of these datasets.

### Web Scrapping Social Media

One of the strategies frequently used by retail traders is trading small cap or penny stocks that gap up in the early
trading hours. These are small companies typically with a big news catalyst that causes their stock price to sky-rocket.
Because they have such a small number of shares available for trading this immense buying pressure can easily cause
them to double or triple in just a single trading day.

However the key to this strategy is discovering these small stocks before they gap up. There are two primary techniques that
traders use to discover these stocks:

1. Using a scanner such as the (TradingView Stock Scanner)[https://www.tradingview.com/screener/]
2. Scouring different forums and trading groups

While the first method is great at discovering a handful of stocks that are primed for gapping up, it does not provide
the detailed information necessary to determine which stock will actually gap up.

This is where the forums and trading groups come into play. People congregate in these groups and share news stories
and trading theories. Remember that these companies being traded are very small so finding information about them
can be difficult.

However, scrolling through forums and trading groups every morning is a tedious and length process. One of the best
forums is Reddit's r/pennystocks A strategy that has worked extremely well in the past is using a Web Scrapping bot to
gather a list of the most commonly mentioned stock tickers. Every morning the bot scraps through the posts and produces
a list of the most popular tickers and what is being said about them.

This is an alternative dataset. It is a unique dataset that is only available to you.

### Consumer Location Data

The big tech companies all use your phones to constantly track your location. They will then aggregate this data to
determine consumer trends. Hedge funds can purchase this location data from a number of data brokers.

Hedge funds can then use this data to determine changes in consumer spending. For example if the location data
shows an increase in foot traffic through all Targets in the US then the hedge fund could take a long position
based on the assumption that Target will beat their expected earnings reports. Hedge funds even use credit card
transation data to cross-reference the location data.

The following (Article from unacast)[https://www.unacast.com/post/hedge-fund-location-data] goes into detail about
how hedge funds use your location data.

If you want to learn more about how location data is used check out this (Article from The Markup)
[https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/09/30/theres-a-multibillion-dollar-market-for-your-phones-location-data].

### Satellite Images

Another dataset that is used to trade is satellite images. Hedge funds will purchase recent satellite images for a
variety of reasons. They can evaluate shipping traffic through places like the Suez Canal. Or analyze the amount of
new construction occuring in Houston chemical plants. Or evaluate the quality and quantity of the wheat harvest both
domestically and internationally. All this data gives them an edge (more commonly known as alpha in the trading industry).
They can use this data to make informed decisions on the health of a country's economy, the capital spending of the oil
industry, or the future price of wheat.

This (Article from Internation Banker)
[https://internationalbanker.com/brokerage/how-satellite-imagery-is-helping-hedge-funds-outperform/] provides some
more examples of how hedge funds use satellites.

## Very Secretive Industry

Gathering the data, cleaning it, and organizing it into a useable dataset takes a massive amount of time, energy, and money.
Understandably these firms are very protective of their datasets. As a result, the public's understanding of alternative data
has barely scratched the surface. The reality is that we really have no idea what data these firms are using to
fuel their trading decisions.
