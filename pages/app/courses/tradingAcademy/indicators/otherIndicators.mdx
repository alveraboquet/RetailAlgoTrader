# Other Common Technical Indicators

## Stochastic Oscillator

The stochastic oscillator is very similar to the RSI. Both are momentum oscillators typically used to determine overbought and oversold areas. The default period for the stochastic oscillator is 14 periods.

The stochastic oscillator is made up of two lines. The K line (the blue line below) and the D line (the orange line below). The K line is the actual stochastics line measuring overbought and oversold. The D line is a 3-period moving average of the K line.

The D line is the line that we will want to pay attention to. Since it is a short-term moving average it removes a lot of the noise of the K line while still responding quickly to the price action.

The stochastic oscillator trades the same as the RSI. When the D-line is above 80 you should be looking for opportunities to short. When the D-Line is below 20 you should be look for opportunities to go long. Below you can see three trading signals produced by Stochastics (2 short and 1 long).

Like RSI this is a leading indicator meaning it is prone to giving off false trading signals. It may show oversold and then continue to drop so do not blindly follow it. The Stochastic Oscillator is best used in combination with another indicator or technique as trade confirmation.

In addition you do not need to use both the RSI and the Stochastic Oscillator as they basically show the same thing.

## Fibonacci Lines

Many of you are probably familiar with the Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦

You take the last two numbers and add them together to get the next number. For such a simple formula the Fibonacci sequence plays a massive role in our lives. It is found everywhere from computer science to biology to mathematics to poetry. Many scholars will describe it as the foundation of everything we know.

So clearly this is a very powerful formula but how does it relate to trading? Quite a while ago traders recognized that if the Fibonacci sequence can be applied to almost every aspect of life then why not trading? This gave rise to the Fibonacci retracement and extension indicators.

Unlike the other indicators we have been studying, the Fibonacci indicators are not a simple click and let the algorithm do its thing. Rather they are more similar to drawing support and resistance lines or trendlines. There is a level of subjectivity and every situation will need to be approached with an open mind in order to accurately draw them.

Requires you to choose two points and draw a line between them. You should pick the most recent local high and local low to draw these points. A local high is just a recent high that has occurred. It is not the absolute high. There may have been a higher high last week but in this case all we care about is a recent high. A local low is the same just opposite.

The theory behind Fibonacci retracements is that after making a large move price will reverse (or retrace) to certain levels before continuing its move.

For example, below price made a large move downward and then lost selling pressure and started to pullback. You can tell it is pulling back because there are 6 or so strong red bars all in a row with a small non-direction bar followed by a strong green bar. So we would want to draw our first point at the local high and our second point at the local low as depicted below. Then the Fibonacci lines will auto populate.

The typical Fibonacci values are 0%, 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 100%, and 127%. There are more you can add but we recommend that you stick with the defaults for now. These are all levels produced by the Fibonacci equation and you can see them marked out in different colors by TradingView.

Now that you have drawn the retracement lines you want to treat the different Fibonacci lines as potential resistance. You want to watch for price to hit one of these levels and reverse back into the downtrend.

Now lets jump forward and see how this trade played out.

{image}

You can see that after we drew our line between the local high and the local low that price shot up until it hit the 100% Fib level. The 100% Fib level acted as resistance and price reversed course. NOTE: The 100% Fib level is particularly strong as it corresponds exactly to the local high. As discussed in the support and resistance lines chapters local highs and lows will frequently act as support and resistance.

After reaching the 100% Fib level price dropped like a rock with just a small upwards rebound off of the 50% Fib level. This brings up an important point. Even after price makes the first rebound of a Fib level it is still good practice to keep the Fib levels on the chart as areas of interest to watch in the future. Once price has moved out of range or a new local high/low has been made you can remove or redraw the Fib levels.

Here is another example. We draw the first point at a local low and the second point at a local high. In this case price made a massive retracement and blew through all of the Fibonacci levels before reversing between the 100% and 127% Fib levels.

This is a case where the Fib levels were not able to accurately predict the initial retracement. Sometimes this happens. However, we kept our Fib levels on the charts and the 50% Fib level ended up later acting as resistance with the 100% Fib level acting as support four separate times.

Drawing Fibonacci lines could almost be a course by itself. It is almost more an art than a science. Since this course has a lot to cover and Fibonacci is just one indicator we will avoid spending too much of your time and energy on it. We encourage you to open up TradingView and experiment with drawing Fibonacci lines on different assets.

If you are interested in learning more there are a variety of resources online that heavily discuss Fibonacci lines with many examples.

Remember that with Fibonacci lines and any other indicator it is largely up to you how exactly to use them. As you long as you can use them in a method that provides a reliable trading signal that you understand you should be in good shape.

## Average Directional Movement Index (ADX)

The Average Directional Movement Index is used to measure the strength of a trend. It has a baseline value of 20. A value below 20 indicates there is no trend or a weak trend. A value above 25 indicates there is a strong trend.

The ADX does not determine or show the direction of a trend. So a strong uptrend will be above 25 and a strong downtrend will also be above 25. The primary way to trade ADX is to use it to look for trend beginnings and reversals.

In the example below you can see two profitable trades based on the ADX. The green lines are where we opened a short trade while the red lines are where we closed the trades. You can see that the green lines correspond to a point on the ADX where the ADX is below 20 but starting to slope up.

This indicates the strength of the trend is improving. The red lines correspond to a point where the slope of the ADX peaked and began to turn down. This indicates that the strength of the trend is weaking and price may trade sideways for a period of time. You can see this particularly well after the second trade. ADX peaked and began to slope down and after ADX's peak price traded sideways for a few weeks.

{image}

ADX is a lagging indicator which means it provides fairly reliable signals. However, that also means it provides trading signals a little late. So it will be difficult to perfectly time the trend reversal. ADX will only begin to peak and slope down once the trend has already begun to slow down.

This is okay though as there is typically plenty of time to get in on the trade and make profit. Just remember you will not be able to perfectly nail the trend reversals everytime.

Like every indicator ADX can also experience fake outs. It may signal the start of a trend but then price just trades sideways. Remember that ADX responds to price action. Price action does not respond to ADX.

If you see ADX is indicating the start of trend but you are unsure which direction price is trending in then place a moving average or two on the chart. These will help show in which direction the average price is moving.

## Average True Range (ATR)

The final indicator we are going to discuss is the Average True Range. ATR is a lagging indicator that measures the average price range over the last 14 periods. The price range is the greatest of the absolute value of the following:

- Current high minus current low
- Current high minus previous close
- Current low minus previous close

ATR is a measure of volatility or how much price has typically been moving in a given day. An asset with a high ATR has been having large price movements and an asset with a low ATR has been having small price movements. It does not make a determination on the direction of price action.

In the example below you can see the ATR indicator on a daily chart of Apple. The ATR is laid across the bottom of the chart with the vertical axis being the average dollar movement for the past 14 days.

You can see in the orange box on the chart that the candlesticks are small which corresponds to the orange box on the ATR indicator which is hovering around $3. You can see that as the candlesticks get larger in the purple box ATR rises up to $5 on the ATR.

{image}

ATR is mostly used to determine where to place stoplosses and takeprofits. A common issue with novice traders is they place their stoplosses too close to their trade entry. We will discuss stoplosses in depth later but just know that a stoploss is an automatic order to close your position if it goes too far against you.

If you are not paying attention to the average volatility of your asset you are trading you could very likely place your stoploss too close to your trade entry. This can cause your trade to automatically close due to normal market movement even if you have the right trade idea.

A common method is to use multiples of ATR to place stoplosses and takeprofits. For example you might place a stoploss at 2ATR and a takeprofit at 3ATR. So if the Average True Range of Tesla is $5 then you would want to place your stoploss $10 (2 _ ATR of $5) below your entry price and your takeprofit $15 (3 _ ATR of $5) above your entry price.

ATR and stoplosses and takeprofits will be discussed more in-depth in the future but this is a good introduction.

## Review

This past chapter covers some of the most common indicators that you will see when trading. They are popular for a reason. They are easy to apply and interpret and provide reliable trading signals.

In addition, because these indicators are so popular they frequently are self-fulfilling. When one of these popular indicators provides a trading signal there are so many traders acting on that trading signal that their actions make the indicator's trading signal come true.

Remember that indicators do not have any effect on price. They are merely a different way to visualize the price action. Price action does not react to indicators. Indicators react to price action.

There are hundreds of indicators out there and a variety of different ways to interpret them. If you come across an indicator you do not recognize or need further example of there are many resources online to help you out.
