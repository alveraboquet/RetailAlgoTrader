# Average True Range

Average true range is a market indicator used to measure market volatility. It returns a positive value that represents how
much price has moved on average in a day over the past X days. Traders use this value to estimate how much price will move
in the near future.

Unlike the other indicators that we have looked at, ATR does not provide an indication on what direction price will move. It
merely provides the recent magnitude of price movement whether it was up or down.

In the below picture we can see the ATR indicator on the daily chart of $MSFT on TradingView. Note that from September to
December the candlesticks are much smaller. There is not much volatility in the market during this time period. Price is not
moving much at all.

ATR reveals that on a typical day price is only moving about $4-$5.

However, when we look at December to February in the above picture we see that the candlesticks grow significantly in size.
As they grow, the value of our ATR indicator grows as well. This is a period of high volatility for the market. ATR reveals
that the average price movement during this time period is $8-$9.

The default period for calculating ATR is 14 days. This is generally agreed to be the sweet spot for period.

However, you can certainly adjust it if you with. A shorter period will result in more trading signals but they will be
weaker. A longer period will result in less trading signals but they will be stronger.

## Average true range formula

The value for true range is derived by finding the greatest value of the following three formulas:

1. Current candlestick's high - current candlestick's low
2. Absolute value of current candlestick's high - previous candlestick's close
3. Absolute value of current candlestick's low - previous candlestick's close

The true range must be calculated for the past 14 bars (or whatever period you have chosen) and then averaged. This average
gives you the average true range.

## Placing orders without ATR

ATR is a very simple and useful method for placing stoplosses and takeprofits that dynamically adjust to market volatility.
Many traders when they are developing their trading systems base their stoplosses and takeprofits on a set amount of dollars
or pips.

We will take another look at our $MFST example from earlier. This time we have two example trades on there. We are trading
a Bollinger Band mean reversion strategy with a set stoploss of $3.00 and a set takeprofit of $6.00.

Let's say that as a trader you decide in October that you would like to start trading $MFST on the daily timeframe. You conduct
some backtesting over August and September and discover that a stoploss at $3.00 below entry price and a takeprofit at $6.00
above entry price is ideal. (Note as we discussed in the backtesting chapter this backtesting process is nowhere near thorough
or lengthy enough but it works well for this demonstration).

As we established earlier from August-December $MFST has an ATR of $4-$5. Your set stoploss of $3.00 and set takeprofit of $6.00
will probably work well through December. We can see that our short trade on 05 Nov '21 is indeed profitable. The stoploss at
$3.00 above entry price gives the trade enough room to breathe. The takeprofit at $6.00 below entry price gets us maximum
profit.

However, starting in January ATR jumps up to $8-$9. Our set stoploss and set takeprofit are now much too small. From January
through March our stoploss and takeprofit range will not provide enough room for the trade to breathe. Average market noise
during this time period will be large enough to trigger our set stoploss of $3.00 and set takeprofit of $6.00.

This can be seen in our second trade on 10 Jan '22. There is a great trade setup with the bottom band broken, small indecision
candle, and large bullish engulfing bar. However, our set stoploss of $3.00 is hit on the very next candle before price even
has a chance to rise towards our takeprofit.

An ATR of $4-$5 vs an ATR of $8-$9 is a huge difference in volatility. These examples demonstrate the importance of using
ATR to place stoplosses and takeprofits.

SIDENOTE: For these two example trades we used the short and long trade feature of TradingView. This is a great feature for
placing stoplosses and takeprofits. It quickly allows you to see R:R ratio, SL and TP distance, potential profit and loss. Read

(https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000475660-how-to-use-long-and-short-position-drawing-tools/) to learn more.

Another issue with the set $3.00 stoploss and the $6.00 takeprofit is that these values will only work on the timeframe it was
backtested on. If you go to a larger timeframe these values will be too small. If you go to a smaller timeframe these values
will be too large.

This is where ATR becomes useful. It allows one rule for placing stoplosses and takeprofits that can adapt to any asset, market,
or timeframe.

## Placing orders with ATR

The best method for using ATR to place stoplosses and takeprofits is to use ratios of the ATR.

For example, you may decide that your stoploss will be 1 ATR below your entry price and your takeprofit will be 2 ATR
above your entry price.

It is easy to see how this will automatically adjust your stoploss and takeprofit to any timeframe, market, or asset. As the ATR
shrinks, your stoploss and takeprofit distance shrink. As the ATR increases, your stoploss and takeprofit distance increases.

Let's take another look at our example trades from earlier but instead we will use ATR to place our takeprofit and stoploss.

Rule for this example:

- Enter at open of bar after trade signal (Eliminates possible gap issues that may occur overnight)
- Stoploss at 0.5\*ATR
- Takeprofit at 1.25\*ATR

As we can see in the example above, using ATR for stoplosses and takeprofits resulted in both of our trades being profitable.
In addition, we were able to increase our R:R ratio from 2 to 2.5. As ATR increased for the second trade so did our stoploss
distance and our takeprofit distance.

## Pros of ATR

- Adapts to any level of market volatility
- Adapts to any timeframe
- Adapts to any asset

## Cons of ATR

- Lags slighlty behind sudden, large price movements
- Does not provide indication at direction of price movement
