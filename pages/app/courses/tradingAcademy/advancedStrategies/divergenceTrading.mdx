# Divergence Trading

A divergence occurs when the price action is trending in one direction and an indicator is trending in another direction. A
divergence signals a potential trend reversal. We do not recommend using a divergence as your sole trading signal. However,
a divergence is a great technique to confirm and validate other trading signals.

Bullish Divergence: Price is setting a lower low while the oscillator is setting a higher low. In this situation while price
is still continuing downward the selling pressure is decreasing. This indicates a reversal may occur.

Bearish Divergence: Price is setting a higher high while the oscillator is setting a lower high. In this situation while price
is still continuing upward the buying pressure is decreasing. This indicates a reversal may occur.

## Trading Divergence with MACD

In the example below you can see that while price is trending downwards, MACD is actually trending upwards. This is an example
of a bullish divergence. Shortly after this divergence price broke out of the downtrend and jumped upwards.

In the second example below you can see that while price is trending upwards, MACD is actually trending downwards. This is an
example of a bearish divergence. Shortly after this divergence price broke out of the uptrend and dropped.

## Trading Divergence with RSI

In the example below EUR/USD is in a strong downtrend. Price is making lower lows from January 2021 until April 2021. RSI is
making lower lows from January 2021 until March 2021 shown by the red dashed line. However, from March 2021 to April 2021 RSI
made a higher low as indicated by the blue dashed line. March 2021 to April 2021 is a bullish divergence. Price is making lower
lows while RSI is making a higher low. You can see that right after this divergence price shot up.

A RSI bearish divergence can be seen in the example below. Price is making higher highs while RSI is making lower highs.
Price then enters a strong downtrend.
