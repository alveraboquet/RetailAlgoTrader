# Scaling into and out of trades

Scaling into and out of trades is the technique of opening and closing many small portions of your trade rather than opening
and closing your entire position with one trade. So far we have really just looked at strategies where you place an order
or a certain position size. You then close out of that entire position at either the takeprofit or stoploss.

By using multiple orders to enter and exit your position you can increase your profits while decreasing risk. One of the largest
benefits to scaling into and out of trades is psychological. As we have emphasized throughout the course, many traders
underestimate how much of an impact their trading psychology has on their performance.

By scaling into and out of positions you decrease the pressure on yourself to get the "perfect" entry and exit. You slowly enter
your trade with multiple smaller orders and slowly exit your trade with multiple smaller orders. This greatly decreases your
psychological stress which can have a huge impact on long-term profitability. With scaling you have acknowledged that it is
impossible to consistently hit a perfect entry and exit. Immediately that pressure is removed. If the entry of one of the
orders is not ideal that is okay because you have more attempts.

The multiple small orders actually do a much better job at achieving a "perfect" entry than trying to time one large order does.
This is due to the multiple small orders averaging out. One order might be below the perfect entry, one might be slightly higher
than the perfect entry, and one might be much higher than the perfect entry. However, when combined together they turn out to
be fairly close to the ideal entry.

If you had just submitted one large order you would only have a 33% chance of being somewhat close to the ideal entry. You would
have a 66% chance of significantly missing the ideal entry (much too low or much too high).

## Risk management with trading scaling

Risk management becomes a little more complicated once you begin scaling into trades. If you do not do it correctly it is very
easy to risk more than you intended. When scaling into your trade your TOTAL risk percentage should not exceed your maximum
allowed risk percentage.

If your max allowed risk percentage on a trade is 3% you should not scale in with three separate orders all at a 3% risk. Essentially
you would be risking 9% on this one trade. Instead you would have three smaller orders all at 1%.

## Example

Scaling into a trade looks very different depending on the strategy. In our example we will look at our Bollinger Band mean reversion
strategy with a capital of $100,000

With this example we will be scaling into trades with two separate trades with a total risk percentage of 2% of our account balance:

1. 1/2 of the position (risk 1%) will be entered at the market close of the engulfing bar

- Stoploss below low of bar that broke band

2. 1/2 of the position (risk 1%) will be entered at the 1 STD Bollinger Band

- Stoploss at 1.5 STD Bollinger Band

We will be scaling out of trades with four separate trades:

1. 1/2 of trade #1 at the moving average (Move trade #1 stoploss to entry price of trade #1) (Now a risk-free trade)
2. Remaining 1/2 of trade #1 at the opposite 1 STD Bollinger Band (Trade #1 now fully closed out)
3. 1/2 of trade #2 at the opposite 1.5 STD Bollinger Band (Move trade #2 stoploss to entry price of trade #2) (Now a risk-free trade)
4. Remaining 1/2 of trade #2 at the opposite 2 STD Bollinger Band (Trade #2 now fully closed out)

### With scaling

The example below identifies a great potential setup for our Bollinger Band mean reversion strategy. The bottom Bollinger Band
has been broken and there is a strong bullish bar following. The blue line indicates our entry price for our first order and
the red line indicates our stoploss for our first order.

  <figcaption>Open buy order #1 and place stoploss</figcaption>
</figure>

Remember our total trade should not exceed 2% risk. As a result, trade #1 will risk 1% and trade #2 will risk 1% for a total
risk of 2%.

Using our entry price, stoploss price, and risk percentage of 1%, [ChartYourTrade's position size calculator](https://chartyourtrade.com/position-size-calculator/)
allows you to calculate the correct position size. See below image for example.

    height={1502}
    width={1411}
    alt=""
  />
  <figcaption>Position size of order #1</figcaption>
</figure>

We can see that the next bar triggered our entry condition at the 1.0 STD Bollinger Band. Our second buy order is now opened
with the stoploss placed at the 1.5 STD Bollinger Band.

    width={3840}

  />
  <figcaption>Open buy order #2 and place stoploss</figcaption>
</figure>

Below you can see the final result of our trade. As price moved out we slowly exited our trades in order to maximize profit
and minimize risk. Now in this case our trade worked out. As a result, the adjusting of the stoplosses is not shown but in
reality they would have been adjusted throughout the trade.

  <figcaption>Takeprofit orders for order #1 and #2</figcaption>

Below we calculate the profit of each order:

<figure className="postTable">

| Order                  | Formula                           | Profit        |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------- |
| First 1/2 of Order #1  | 0.5 \* 182 \* ($161.41 - $154.96) | $586.95       |
| Second 1/2 of Order #1 | 0.5 \* 182 \* ($165.60 - $154.96) | $968.24       |
| First 1/2 of Order #2  | 0.5 \* 337 \* ($168.24 - $157.37) | $1,831.60     |
| Second 1/2 of Order #2 | 0.5 \* 337 \* ($171.81 - $157.37) | $2,433.14     |
| **Total Profit**       |                                   | **$5,819.93** |

</figure>

Total profit of $5,819.93 at a risk of $2,000.

### No scaling

Now let's take a look at the same example; however, we do not use any scaling techniques.

In this example we simply open one order when our entry conditions are met and exit the order when our
takeprofit is hit.

<figure>
  <Image
    src="/images/courses/tradingAcademy/advancedStrategies/scalingIntoAndOutOf/tradeNoScale.webp"
    height={2160}
    width={3840}
    alt=""
  />
  <figcaption>Trade with no scaling</figcaption>
</figure>

Below we calculate the total profit from this trade.

<figure className="postTable">

| Order            | Formula                    | Profit        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ------------- |
| Order #1         | 370 \* ($161.41 - $154.96) | $2,386.60     |
| **Total Profit** |                            | **$2,386.60** |

</figure>

Total profit of $2,386.60 at a risk of $2,000. Not a bad trade but we made less than half of the profit and had about a
1:1 R:R which is not ideal. In this situation the trade worked out in our favor, but if the trade had hit our stoploss instead
we would have lost $2,000.

Scaling into and out of trades can increase profitability while also decreasing risk.

## Pros

- Potential for greater profit
- Decrease risk if trade does not go as expected
- Decreases psychological stress

## Cons

- Must manage multiple orders
