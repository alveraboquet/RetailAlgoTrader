# Cointegration

Cointegration is an advanced strategy with a lot of profit potential and relatively low risk if done correctly. Cointegration
occurs when you have two assets that consistently return to an equilibrium. These assets will trade very similarly but not
identically. Cointegration strategies are also commonly referred to as pairs trading.

If two assets are cointegrated there is a limit to how different their price can be. If the price difference becomes
too large then these assets will move back towards each other. The key to cointegration strategies is calculating the price
threshold (aka the spread) at which diverging assets will return to an equilibrium.

Once the price difference between the assets reaches that threshold, you short the more expensive asset and buy the less
expensive asset.

The advantage of cointegration strategies over the other strategies that we have looked at is that it is market neutral. You
do not care if the market is trending or ranging. You do not care if the less expensive asset increases in price or if the
more expensive asset decreases in price.

This is the true power of a cointegration strategy. It eliminates the need to make an estimation at what direction price will
take. This results in an uncorelated return with the overall market. A strategy with a consistently profitable return that is
not correlated with market return is one of the most robust strategies available.

It is rumored that Jim Simons and the Medallion Fund mostly trade market-neutral strategies such as cointegration strategies.
This is one of the, if not the most, profitable hedge funds of all time. Clearly pairs trading is an important skill to
develop.

If you want to learn more about the Medallion Fund I highly recommend Gregory Zuckerman's book (The Man Who Solved the Market)
[https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Solved-Market-Revolution/dp/073521798X/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=].

## Cointegration scenarios

In the following examples we have already calculated the price difference threshold at which we estimate price will
return to equilibrium. When price breaks our calculated threshold, we will short the more expensive asset and buy the less
expensive asset. We will look at the three possible scenarios that can occur when two assets reach our price
difference threshold.

### Assets converge together

This scenario occurs when the more expensive asset drops in price and the less expensive asset rises in price until they
meet back in the equilibrium. This results in a profitable short trade and a profitable long trade.

In the below example we are looking at the ES1! (S&P 500 E-mini Futures) and NQ1! (Nasdaq E-mini Futures) overlaid on top
of each other. This is a very useful TradingView feature. In the top left corner where you choose the chart symbol there is
a plus symbol.

This plus symbol allows you to select multiple assets to compare on one chart. The vertical axis will change to price percent
change to allow equal comparison across assets. We recommend changing to a line graph to allow easy comparison.

As you can see in the above chart, the assets move very similarly but not exactly. We have marked many spots where the price
diverged an unusual amount and then quickly converged. This appears to be a very promising cointegrating relationship. However,
there are some tests that we need to perform to confirm.

### More expensive asset does not move / increases slighlty

This scenario occurs when the more expensive asset does not move much or maybe even increases in price. This will result in a
small losing short trade. However, if the assets are cointegrated the less expensive asset will see a large rise in price in order
to restore equilibrium. This will result in a large profitable buy trade.

The profits of the buy trade will more than make up for the small losses from the sell trade. With this strategy we do not need
both trades to be profitable. As long as the assets are cointegrated and you are buying/selling at the extremes of the historical
price difference, the trade will be profitable.

### Less expensive asset does not move / decreases slighlty

This is the same situation as the previous scenario just reversed. In this scenario the less expensive asset does not move
much or even decreases in price. This will result in a small losing buy trade. However, if the assets are cointegrated the more
expensive asset will see a large drop in price in order to restore equilibrium. This will result in a large profitable sell
trade that covers the losses from the buy trade.

### Assets diverge

This is the primary risk of a cointegration strategy. If the assets break your threshold but continue to diverge it is possible
to accrue massive loses quickly without a proper risk management strategy. Your short trade on the more expensive asset will
lose money as its' price continues to rise. Your buy trade on the less expensive asset will lose money as its' price
continues to fall.

The below example plots the price movements of ES1! (S&P 500 E-mini Futures) and $TSLA. The price movements of these two
assets are all over the place. These assets do not have a cointegration relationship and attempting a pairs trading strategy
on these assets would result in large losses.

Remember that cointegration is not a law that the asset must follow. It is simply a historical pattern that you have discovered
through statistical analysis and backtesting. As long as this pattern continues, you have a low-risk, market-neutral method
at making profit. However, once this pattern stops for whatever reason this strategy can quickly lose significant capital.

## How to limit risks of cointegration

As we saw, the main risk with a cointegration strategy is that price will continue to diverge when you expect it to move
back towards equilibrium. This can happen for any number of reasons. The fundamentals of the stocks may change, a black swan
event may occur, etc.

The best technique for avoiding this situation is to have a proper understanding of why the two assets are cointegrated. If you
understand the fundamental reasons that cause two assets to cointegrate then you can predict what conditions will cause the
assets to fail to cointegrate.

For example, there are a couple explanations for why S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures appear to be cointegrated.

1. They both reflect the US economy
2. They have a large number of companies (the effects of individual companies on the index is minimized)
3. They pull companies from many of the same industries
4. Both are weighted by market capitalization

Now it makes sense why these two assets may have a strong cointegration relationship. If we took a look at the Dow futures and
the Russell 2000 futures we may realize that all four of these assets have a cointegration relationship.

However, there a couple of differences with these indexes that could result in a weaker cointegration relationship or even
none at all.

1. The Dow only tracks 30 large blue-chip stocks
2. The Dow lacks many industries
3. The Dow is weighted by stock price
4. The Russell 2000 tracks small-cap stocks and has little overlap with the other three indexes

Conducting analysis such as this is vital for understanding why a cointegration relationship may exist.

Many times, especially with the limited resources of retail traders, we will not be able to determine why two assets are
cointegrated. That is okay. We just need to ensure that we have a strong risk management strategy.

A strong risk management strategy is so important as the profits of cointegration strategies are capped. Once the assets return
to an equilibrium price your potential for profit is over.

With a cointegration strategy you will not land any home-run trades that result in massive profit. Instead you will have many
trades with a small amount of profit.

## How to calculate cointegration

There are a couple of methods used to test for cointegration. These methods are more advanced statistical methods so we will
not dive into the specifics.

Cointegration is a very difficult strategy to effeciently and correctly pursue as a manual retail trader. This is why we
really save this topic for our algorithmic trading courses.

We just mention this information so that if you see these topics discussed you understand what is being referred to.

If you would like to learn more about the following two cointegration tests this [article from APTECH]
(https://www.aptech.com/blog/a-guide-to-conducting-cointegration-tests/) is a great resource.

### Engle-Granger method

This is the first method for determining if two assets are cointegrated.

If you are only testing cointegration of two assets then the Engle-Granger method is sufficient. However, if you are scanning
a large quantity of assets to find cointegrating relationships then you will need to use the Johansen test.

### Johansen Test

This is the second method for determining if two assets are cointegrated.

The Johansen test can be used to test a large quantity of assets for cointegration relationships.

## Cointegration example with TradingView

The two assets will not always return exactly to equilibrium. Need to determine at what point you want to take profit.

## What assets to trade with cointegration

As we discussed above, the profitability of cointegration trades is limited. As a result, many traders prefer to trade futures
and forex with cointegration strategies. Both futures and forex offer large leverage which can turn small profitable trades
into large profitable trades.

The downside of this is that leverage also magnifies your losses. This is why we recommend starting with stocks as there is
less leverage. Once you have a good understanding of cointegration and you know how to handle the risks, then you can move
onto futures or forex.

## Conclusion

Cointegration strategies are some of the best strategies out there if done correctly. Relatively low-risk and market-neutral
can lead to significant and consistent profits.

In order to efficiently and effectively discover cointegration relationships and develop systems to trade these relationships,
you really need to delve into the world of algorithmic trading. Attempting to manually discover and trade cointegration
relationships is very resource-intensive and it is easy to make a mistake.

In addition, pairs trading involves shorting. With futures and forex this is a straight-forward process. With stocks it is
a little more difficult. You typically need to get approval from your broker and you have to pay short interest on any
open short positions.
