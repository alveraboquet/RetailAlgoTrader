# Cointegration

Cointegration is an advanced strategy with a lot of profit potential and relatively low risk if done correctly. Cointegration
occurs when you have two assets that consistently return to an equilibrium. These assets will trade very similarly but not
identically.

However, if these assets are cointegrated there is a limit to how different their price can be. If the price difference becomes
too large then these assets will move back towards each other. The key to cointegration strategies is calculating the price
threshold at which diverging assets will return to an equilibrium.

Once the price difference between the assets reaches that threshold, you short the more expensive asset and buy the less
expensive asset.

The advantage of cointegration strategies over the other strategies that we have looked at is that it is market neutral. You
do not care if the market is trending or ranging. You do not care if the less expensive asset increases in price or if the
more expensive asset decreases in price.

This is the true power of a cointegration strategy. It eliminates the need to make an estimation at what direction price will
take.

## Cointegration scenarios

In the following examples we have already calculated the price difference threshold at which we estimate price will
return to equilibrium. When price breaks our calculated threshold, we will short the more expensive asset and buy the less
expensive asset. We will look at the three possible scenarios that can occur when two assets reach our price
difference threshold.

### Assets converge together

This scenario occurs when the more expensive asset drops in price and the less expensive asset rises in price until they
meet back in the equilibrium. This results in a profitable short trade and a profitable long trade.

### More expensive asset does not move / increases slighlty

This scenario occurs when the more expensive asset does not move much or maybe even increases in price. This will result in a
small losing short trade. However, if the assets are cointegrated the less expensive asset will see a large rise in price in order
to restore equilibrium. This will result in a large profitable buy trade.

The profits of the buy trade will more than make up for the small losses from the sell trade. With this strategy we do not need
both trades to be profitable. As long as the assets are cointegrated and you are buying/selling at the extremes of the historical
price difference, the trade will be profitable.

### Less expensive asset does not move / decreases slighlty

This is the same situation as the previous scenario just reversed. In this scenario the less expensive asset does not move
much or even decreases in price. This will result in a small losing buy trade. However, if the assets are cointegrated the more
expensive asset will see a large drop in price in order to restore equilibrium. This will result in a large profitable sell
trade that covers the losses from the buy trade.

### Assets diverge

This is the primary risk of a cointegration strategy. If the assets break your threshold but continue to diverge it is possible
to accrue massive loses quickly without a proper risk management strategy. Your short trade on the more expensive asset will
lose money as its' price continues to rise. Your buy trade on the less expensive asset will lose money as its' price
continues to fall.

Remember that cointegration is not a law that the asset must follow. It is simply a historical pattern that you have discovered
through statistical analysis and backtesting. As long as this pattern continues, you have a low-risk, market-neutral method
at making profit. However, once this pattern stops for whatever reason this strategy can quickly lose significant capital.

## How to limit risks of cointegration

As we saw, the main risk with a cointegration strategy is that price will continue to diverge when you expect it to move
back towards equilibrium. This can happen for any number of reasons.

The best technique for avoiding this situation is to have a proper understanding of why the two assets are cointegrated. If you
understand the fundamental reasons that cause two assets to cointegrate then you can predict what conditions will cause the
assets to fail to cointegrate.

Many times, expecially with the limited resources of retail traders, we will not be able to determine why two assets are
cointegrated. That is okay. We just need to ensure that we have a strong risk management strategy.

A strong risk management strategy is so important as the profits of cointegration strategies are capped. Once the assets return
to an equilibrium price your potential for profit is over.

With a cointegration strategy you will not land any home-run trades that result in massive profit. Instead you will have many
trades with a small amount of profit.

### Johansen Test

## Cointegration example with TradingView

The two assets will not always return exactly to equilibrium. Need to determine at what point you want to take profit.

## What assets to trade with cointegration

As we discussed above, the profitability of cointegration trades is limited. As a result, many traders prefer to trade futures
and forex with cointegration strategies. Both futures and forex offer large leverage which can turn small profitable trades
into large profitable trades.

The downside of this is that leverage also magnifies your losses. This is why we recommend starting with stocks as there is
less leverage. Once you have a good understanding of cointegration and you know how to handle the risks, then you can move
onto futures or forex.
