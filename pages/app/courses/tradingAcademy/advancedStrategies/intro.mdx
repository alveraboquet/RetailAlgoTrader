# Advanced Trading Strategies

Throughout this course we have established the fundamentals of trading and the markets. We have looked at different technical
and fundamental strategies such as Bollinger Band mean reversion and news trading. These are great strategies to begin with. They
are easy to backtest and easy to trade. In addition, they provide a fantastic foundation for more advanced strategies.

However, as you progress through your trading journey you will want to advance your strategies as well. In this chapter we will
discuss a couple of methods you can use to take your trading strategies to the next level:

- Scaling into and out of trades
- Divergence trading
- Multiple timeframes
- Volatility
- Leading assets
- Cointegration
- Seasonal Trends
