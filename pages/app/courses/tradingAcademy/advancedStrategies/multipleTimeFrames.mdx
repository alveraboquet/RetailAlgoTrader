# Multiple Timeframe Analysis

Many day traders that focus on shorter timeframes have a poor understanding and awareness of the bigger picture. Remember that
the shorter the timeframe the greater the noise. At a 5m timeframe much of the price action is not going to be meaningful and
your trade signals will be less strong. At a daily timeframe noise is not much of an issue and your trade signals will be very
strong.

This does not mean you should not trade short timeframes. Instead you need to use multiple time frame analysis to track larger
market trends while trading on the short timeframes. This will ensure that you understand whether or not you are trading with
the trend and if there are any key S/R levels on the higher timeframes.

When trading with multiple timeframe analysis, it is typically best to use three different timeframes. If you use less than
this you miss out on some of the benefits of multiple timeframe analysis and using more is unnecessary.

## Setting it up

To get started with multiple timeframes you first need to determine how long your average trade is held. This timeframe will
be used as your primary timeframe. So if your trades typically take 12h then your primary timeframe will be 12h. If your trades
typically take 15m then your primary timeframe will be 15m.

Your primary timeframe will act as your medium timeframe. You will then need to establish your short-term timeframe. Your
short-term timeframe should be about 1/4 of your primary timeframe. So if your primary timeframe is 12h your short-term
timeframe will be 4h. If your primary timeframe is 15m then your short-term timeframe will be 5m or 1m.

Next you need to establish your long-term timeframe. Your long-term timeframe should be about x4 your primary timeframe. So
if your primary timeframe is 12h your long-term timeframe will be the daily. (Most charting software and brokers only offer
daily, weekly, and monthly for longer timeframes so just choose whatever is closest). If your primary timeframe is 15m then
your long-term timeframe will be 1h.

1. Determine how long your average trade is held
2. Set your medium-term / primary chart to average trade hold time
3. Set the short-term chart to 1/4 of medium-term
4. Set the long-term chart to x4 of medium-term

Most traders use multiple screens with multiple charts. This allows them to view the same asset across different timeframes
all at once. If you only have a laptop or a phone you can still use multiple timeframes. The majority of charting software
will allow you to jump back and forth between timeframes without deleting your drawings and notes on the chart.

## Example

During this example, we will be trading $MSFT with TradingView. After conducting some backtesting, we discover that our
trades typically take 3-5 hours to play out. As a result, we decide to use the 4h timeframe as our primary chart. This means
that our short-term chart will be the 1h chart and the long-term chart will the daily chart.

For a strategy we will be using a simple bollinger band mean reversion strategy. If price breaks the upper or lower band
and it is followed by a strong mean reverting bar then it is a potential trade signal.

### How to use long-term chart

The long-term chart is the first chart that you will look at. Take note of the overall trend of the market. In addition, mark
all significant S/R levels that you see. You should pick a specific color for all long-term chart drawings. As you drop to the
lower timeframes, these S/R levels will become extremely important.

As we can see in the picture below, $MSFT has been in a slight downtrend for the past couple of months. For the daily chart
we have drawn the key S/R levels in green. Note that sometimes you have to scroll to the left in order to find the key
levels.

For example the following picture demonstrates how we found the 239.60 key level and the 226.74 key level.

### How to use primary chart

The primary chart is where you will spend most of your time. This is the chart that you watch for trade signals and where you
do the majority of your analysis. When watching for trade signals pay special attention to the S/R levels you drew on the
long-term chart. You should use a different color for this chart than you did for your long-term chart.

Remember that the longer the timeframe the stronger the S/R levels. When a trade signal on your primary chart lines up with a
S/R level from the long-term chart then that provides even more strength to the trade signal.

In addition, when your system issues a trade signal on your primary chart make sure you keep the long-term trend in mind. If your
system is a trend-following system it might issue a decent sell signal. However, if the long-term chart is in a strong uptrend
it is probably a bad idea to try and trade against the long-term trend. The lower timeframes might have a weak, temporary
trend reversal, but the strong uptrend on the longer timeframe will most likely win.

Below you can see the 4h chart with our analysis. Note that our S/R levels from the daily chart is still there.

#### Trade Option #1

This potential trade occurs at a key S/R level from the daily chart. Price breaks the lower band and is followed by a
bullish bar. However, the bullish bar is not that strong when compared to recent bearish bars. In addition, because we looked
at the daily chart we know that $MSFT is in a downtrend.

We decide the trade signal is not strong enough to trade against the trend. Turns out this was an intelligent decision as the
buying pressure quickly faded before price even reached the moving average.

This is an instance where the long-term chart kept us out of a losing trade.

#### Trade Option #2

This potential trade also occurs at a key S/R level from the daily chart. Again price breaks the lower band and is followed by
a hammer candlestick pattern. This is typically a bullish signal; however, it is only about half the size of the bearish
candle that broke the lower band. In addition, because we looked at the daily chart we know that $MSFT is in a downtrend.

We decide the trade signal is not strong enough to trade against the trend. Turns out price actually made a decent little
pullback but it still barely made it to the moving average. This is an instance where analyzing multiple timeframes kept us
out of a trade that would have been somewhat profitable.

#### Trade Option #3

For the third time this potential trade occurs at a key S/R level from the daily chart. This time price breaks the upper band
and is followed by a strong bearish engulfing bar. In addition, because we looked at the daily chart we know that $MSFT is in a
downtrend.

By itself the strong bearish bar at the upper Bollinger Band would be a strong trade signal. When you combine it with the fact
that it is at a key S/R level from the long-term chart and the long-term chart indicates a downtrend it becomes an extremely
strong trade signal. As we can see, after this trade signal price chopped up and down a little bit before dropping like a
rock.

This is an instance where analyzing multiple timeframes gave us strong confirmation that a short trade would be profitable.

### How to use short-term chart

After a trade signal has been issued, the short-term chart becomes important. The short term chart is used to get more precise
entries. At this point you should have S/R levels and varying analysis from both your long-term and your primary chart.

By dropping to a lower timeframe you get a much more detailed look at the chart. You can more precisly place your entry orders,
stoploss orders, and takeprofit orders. At the lower timeframe it is much easier to understand how price action is interacting
with the key levels you marked at the higher timeframes.

For example, if you tried to do everything on the 4h timeframe you would miss out on key long-term info and your order placement
would be less precise. On the 4h timeframe you might be able to place your orders within a couple of dollars of the ideal
price. However, on the 1h timeframe you might be able to place your orders within a couple of cents of the ideal price.

At first glance this does not appear to make a huge difference. However, when trading every small advantage can turn into
significant profitability over the long-term.

Below you can see how much more chart detail we were able to see when we dropped to the 1h timeframe. The candlestick circled
in yellow is where you would have entered if you had just been using the 4h chart. However, since we dropped down to the
1h chart we decide to wait for a retest of the daily S/R level marked in green.

<figure className="centerFigure">
  <Image
    src="/images/courses/tradingAcademy/advancedStrategies/multipleTimeFrames/shortTermTrade.webp"
    height={2160}
    width={3840}
    alt=""

  <figcaption>Trade Entry on 1h Chart</figcaption>
</figure>

We see that price takes a small dip down, reverses up, attempts to break the S/R level, forms a small indecision candle, and
is followed by an engulfing bearish bar that closes below the S/R level. This situation can be seen circled in grey. Price
again tried to break the daily S/R level and failed to do so. This is known as a retest of the S/R level. In this case it is a
bearish signal indicating that price is unable to exceed that level.

We decide to enter on this retest with the stoploss marked in red and the entry order marked in purple. Below you can see how
much of a difference entering at the 1h timeframe instead of the 4h timeframe made to our trade's profitability.

Usual strategy:

- Enter at market close of bearish bar ($270.92)
- Stoploss above bearish bar high ($278.10)
- At 2% risk and $100,000 capital we could buy 278 shares

1h Chart:

- Enter at market close of bearish retest bar ($272.33)
- Stoploss above bearish retest bar high ($275.14)
- At 2% risk and $100,000 capital we could buy 711 shares

For the exact same risk of $2,000 we can more than double our potential profit through the use of the 1h timeframe for entries.
This is because with the 1h timeframe we can more more precisly place our entry order and our stoploss order.

This is why trader who know what they are doing will drop down to lower timeframes for entering trades. The closer the
stoploss price to the entry price the greater the number of shares that you can purchase at a set risk percentage. The greater
the number of shares in a trade the greater the potential profit.

## Pros of Multiple Timeframe Analysis

- Stronger trade signals
- More precise entries
- Awareness of overall market trends and key S/R levels

## Cons of Multiple Timeframe Analysis

- More difficult to keep track of multiple timeframes
- Can miss out on potential trades

## Conclusion

Using multiple timeframes is a relatively low-effort way to significantly increase quality of trade signals as well as your
Risk:Reward ratio. If you do not have much experience with trading we recommend sticking with one chart until you become
more familiar with trading and your strategy.

Keeping track of multiple timeframes can be a little confusing and difficult for begineer traders.
