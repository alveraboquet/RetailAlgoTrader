# Leading Assets

One of the most profitable strategies in existence is the use of leading assets. A leading asset can be used to predict almost
exactly the price movements of another asset.

A strategy built upon a leading asset requires you to find a pair of assets with a very unique relationship. These assets must
have the exact same or nearly the exact same price movements. When one asset moves up the other asset moves up. When one asset
moves down the other asset moves down.

At first glance this seems easy. For example, gold and silver move almost identically. Bitcoin and Ethereum make the same
price moves. The trick is finding assets that move the same, but one asset moves before the other asset does.

This is where the phrase leading asset comes from. One asset's "leads" the other asset's price. If you can find a genuine
leading asset relationship you can exploit it for insane profits.

The sinusoidal curves below demonstrate what the ideal leading asset relationship would be. The blue line moves roughly half
a period before the black line moves.

If these curves were two different assets it would be simple to create a system that trades the blue asset based on the
price movements of the black asset.

Leading asset strategies provide what is essentially a consistent, risk-free trade which allows you to leverage your capital
for maximum profit.

## Issue with leading asset strategies

Unfortunately it is almost impossible to find these kinds of trading opportunities. Every hedge fund, statisician, data scientist,
economist, etc have scoured the markets for these kinds of relationships.

Nearly all of these relationships have already been discovered. And when one of these relationships is discovered it is quickly
exploited for maximum profit. Traders will create algorithmic systems to take advantage of the leading asset.

As more and more traders launch their systems the time difference between the leading asset's price movements and the following
asset's price movements becomes smaller and smaller. This continues until the leading asset and the following asset move at the
same time.

At which point this trade opporutnity is gone for the majority of traders. Hedge funds can still pursue these opportunities as
it now becomes a high frequency trading opportunity but this is not achievable for the vast majority of traders.

## How to find leading assets in today's markets

This type of relationship is still possible to trade. It just requires some creativity and a willingness to jump into
unfamiliar markets.

For example, in the early years of crytocurrency many traders were able to find these types of relationships amongst different
cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately, the hedge funds have now entered the crypto markets and these opportunities have dried up.

The below image shows the price of ETH overlaid on BTC. As you can see marked by the vertical purple lines, BTC and ETH make
the exact same price moves at the exact same time. It is not reasonable for a retail trader to use one of these assets as a
leading indicator.

Other potential markets are penny stocks or international stock markets. Really you are looking for any market that receives
little attention from hedge funds. This will typically be smaller, less regulated markets so be sure to do your research
into any market before trading.
