# Cons of Technical Analysis

Technical analysis will have many losing trades. History does not repeat itself exactly but it does tend to resemble itself. Even if a pattern has held true in the past it is not a guarantee it will hold true in the future. Technical analysis is all about gaining a slight edge so that over a long time span you come out positive. This can be tough to handle psychologically.

TA can provide signals that are opposite of what the fundamentals suggest. When this occurs it can be very difficult to determine which direction to trade.

If you exclusively practice TA you can get blindsided by news events. News events tend to have a large impact on price. This is why even as a TA trader it is important to pay attention to the fundamentals to a degree.
