# Support and Resistance Levels

When you are analyzing the charts on TradingView you may notice that price seems to hover around certain prices. At these levels you can notice that price tends to rebound and when it doesn't rebound it has a strong price movement after breaking through the level.

These price levels are known as support and resistance levels. When you see price touching the same level multiple times then you have a prime support and resistance level. Traders will draw a horizontal line at these levels. With strong support and resistance levels price almost always strongly rebounds off or strongly breakthroughs.

## Support Levels

Support levels are drawn as “floors” for price action. You will see price drop down to this level and rebound up multiple times. Below you can see that price touched the same level and rebounded five separate times before it took off.

This is a strong support level. Notice that at the second touch price actually breaks through the line a little bit before rapidly returning. Price attempted to break through this level but was unable to which strengthens the support level.

## Resistance Levels

Resistance levels are drawn as “ceilings” for price action. You will see price rise up to this level and rebound down off of it multiple times. Below you can see that price has touched the same level three times. There is a decent chance that price will continue to rebound off of this level.

## Support Turned Resistance and Vice Versa

When a support or resistance level is broken many traders erase it from their charts and move on. However, very often a broken support level will now become a strong resistance level. A broken resistance level will frequently become a strong support level.

For example the chart below has a price level marked. As you can see price comes down and touches the marked level three times before breaking through. Price then comes up and touches the same marked level six times before dropping down.

## S/R are Areas not Lines

It is important to point out that S/R levels are rarely an exact price level. It is almost always a zone. Many traders prefer to draw boxes at strong price levels instead of lines as this more accurately represents S/R areas.

Price will frequently extend into these areas before rebounding. You may even think that the level has broken before it rapidly rebounds. It is not an exact science.

## Trading S/R Levels

There are two primary trading strategies when it comes to S/R Levels:

### Trading the Rebound

People that trade the rebound believe price will touch the level and then reverse course. You can wait for price to hit the level and then rebound before entering the trade. This act of waiting for price to actually start rebounding before you enter the trade is called trade confirmation.

This will give you a greater win rate but you will have a worse entry to the trade. Can use stop orders for trade entry.

You can enter the trade as soon as price touches the level. You do not wait for it to rebound. This will get you the best possible entrance price but price may end up not rebounding. It could break through the level which would result in a losing trade for you. This strategy has a lower win rate but the winning trades are worth me.

### Trading the breakout

People that trade the breakout assume that price will break through the level and the take off. This type of trade is called the breakout because when price breaches a strong S/R level it tends to take off and make a large price movement.

Some traders wait for price to breakthrough and then touch again before entering a trade. Some traders set a stop order below / above levels.

Trading exclusively off of S/R levels is not recommended. They are more an area of interest that you should pay attention to. They are ideal to use in combination with an indicator.
