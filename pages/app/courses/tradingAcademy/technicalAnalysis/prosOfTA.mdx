# Pros of Technical Analyis

Requires limited time and resources. Everything you need is right there on the chart. Unlike fundamental analysis where you have to spend time reading reports and watching news events. Technical analysis requires considerably less time and energy.

Technical analysis opens up the opportunity to trade short-term. When you are day trading you almost have to rely on technical analysis for your trading system.

With technical analysis it is very easy to create a strict rules-based trading system. This eliminates a lot of the psychological issues in trading. Easy to backtest. With a technical analysis based trading strategy backtesting is as simple as clicking back through the charts.

Technical analysis is repeatable. Once you learn the patterns to look for it is as simple as watching for those patterns. Fundamental analysis you may spend an entire day reading reports in order to make a trading decision. And then next week you have to start the whole process over again. It is much more difficult to scale up.

A HUGE advantage of trading strategies based on indicators is that you can automate some or all of it. These are strategies that can run while you are at work and sleeping.

Technical analysis is so popular in the industry that a lot of times the believe in technical analysis is more impactful than the actual technical analysis. Traders will be watching trendlines or strong support and resistance levels waiting for breakouts or rebounds. Everybody will pile on and drive the price in the same direction causing breakouts and large price jumps.
