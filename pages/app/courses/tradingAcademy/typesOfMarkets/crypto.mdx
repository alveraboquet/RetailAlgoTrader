You can trade fiat currencies such as the USD for various cryptocurrencies. Or you can trade cryptocurrencies for other cryptocurrencies.

The major difference between the crypto market and other markets is that the crypto markets are decentralized and unregulated. This course does not focus on crypto trading. If you would like to learn more be sure to take our trading equities and crypto with TradingView course.
