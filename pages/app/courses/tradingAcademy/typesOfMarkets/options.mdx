# Options Market

## Overview

Options are a type of contract present in many different markets. Options give the owner the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a certain amount of shares at a predetermined price before or when the contract expires.

When you hear about calls, spreads, and puts this refers to options. Options make use of leverage which means that you can make more money (but also lose more money) than by buying and selling shares.

Options get very complicated very fast. This course will not focus on options other than this brief overview. There is much you need to learn and practice before you will be ready for options. Trading options is a totally separate animal from other types of trading.

## Size of Market

Options trade on the derivatives market which includes other types of contracts such as futures. It is difficult to estimate the size of the derivatives market; however, some estimates range as high as one quadrillion USD. This is due to the fact that nearly all assets have a wide variety of contracts (options, futures, etc) available on them.

## Market Participants

- Retail Traders
- Government
- Hedge Funds
- Retirement Funds
- Pension Funds
- Banks

## When are Markets Open

Options trade on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) during standard NYSE trading hours. The core trading hours are 9:30 am to 4:00 pm EST.

Options typically do not trade during extended hours. See the [NYSE calendar](https://www.nyse.com/markets/hours-calendars) for special hours and holidays that may affect market hours.

## Recommended Capital

As stated earlier it is not recommended to begin trading options until one has significant experience in the markets. Hopefully by this time you have saved up sufficient capital.

Ideally you will want at least $10,000 to begin options trading. There are a wide variety of options strategies but $10,000 should provide enough to execute most of them.
