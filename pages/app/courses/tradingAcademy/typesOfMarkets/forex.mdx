# Forex Market

## Overview

Forex (foreign exchange market) is a global market for the exchange of currencies. The forex market dwarves all other markets in terms of trading volume. Any individual or entity that exchanges currencies is taking part in the Forex market.

If you have ever traveled out of country and had to exchange currency at one of the currency exchange booths at the airport than you have already participated in the Forex market. Investing in Forex is like directly investing in a foreign country's economy. You are betting that their currency's strength will increase in comparison to your currency.

The major participants in the Forex market are governments (typically via their central banks), banks, corporations, hedge funds, prop trading firms, and individual traders. With the emergence of retail trading opportunities over the past decade, individual traders are estimated to make up roughly 10% of spot trading volume in the Forex market.

Governments / Central Banks use the Forex market to reach manage their monetary goals such as inflation rates and interest rates. Banks use the Forex markets to exchange currencies for clients and to broker international dealers. They use to speculatively trade (trade purely for profit) at one point. However, now this is largely illegal as it was a conflict of interests for the banks.

Corporations use the forex market for a couple of reasons. One is to purchase goods from an international supplier or manufacturer for import. Another is to hedge their risks.

If a corporation has a large ongoing deal with an international supplier and the US dollar is expected to strengthen or weaken compared to the supplier's currency, the corporation will most likely exchange some of their capital for the international supplier's currency in order to decrease risk.

Hedge funds and mutual funds will use the Forex market to purchase foreign securities. For example if you invest in a fund that purchases securities from emerging markets the manager of that fund most likely takes your money, converts it to the local currency, and then buys those emerging market securities on the foreign exchanges.

Unlike futures or equities, Forex trades in pairs. For example you cannot individually trade the US dollar or the British pound. You trade the USD / GBP pair of GBP / USD pair. Everything in Forex trades as a pair.

Unlike the equities market which are heavily regulated by various exchanges, Forex is a decentralized market with little oversight. Now this does not mean it is a scam or untrustworthy. After all governments, banks, and corporations all make many transactions in these markets on a daily basis.

## Size of Market

The forex market on average trades around $6.5 trillion a day while all stock exchanges combined only add up to about $200 billion a day. Now granted only about $2 trillion of the Forex volume is spot Forex which is what us retail traders will be working with. This is still a crazy high volume.

## When are Markets Open

### Tokyo, New York, London

Forex trades 24 hours a day during the week. This is one of the reasons it is one of the best markets to get started in if you work a day job. You can trade before your job or after your job depending on your schedule.

That being said there are times that are definitely better to trade than other times. These times offer higher volatility and volume with lower spreads which means there is more money to be made. There are four primary trading sessions: the Sydney session, the Tokyo session, the London session, and the New York session.

The forex trading day starts with the beginning of the day in Auckland, New Zealand which is known as the Sydney session. As the day progresses the Asian cities will rise and go to work which is known as the Tokyo session. Then morning will hit Europe and they will start trading as the Tokyo session winds down which is known as the London session.

Finally morning will reach North America and US traders begin trading as the London session slows down. This is known as the New York session. Finally the New York session will end and the whole process will start over.

While the sessions are typically referred to by specific cities it is more accurate to think of them as entire geographic areas.

- Sydney Session = New Zealand and Australia
- Tokyo Session = Asia
- London Session = Europe
- New York Session = Americas

The trading week begins with Monday morning in Auckland and ends with Friday afternoon in New York. In between these two points the forex market is open. This means that for North American traders the markets open at 5:00 PM EST on Sunday; however, price movement and liquidity are very low until the Tokyo session starts up at 7:00 PM EST

Trading Session Open (EST) Close (EST)
Sydney 4:00 PM 1:00 AM
Tokyo 7:00 PM 4:00 AM
London 2:00 AM 11:00 AM
New York 8:00 AM 5:00 PM

Keep in mind for a large part of the year this is not accurate due to daylight savings time. Use [Babypips market hours tool](https://www.babypips.com/tools/forex-market-hours) to check what time different sessions open and close. This also shows trading volume.

## Session Overlaps

As you can see some of the sessions overlap:

- The Sydney and Tokyo overlap from 7:00 PM EST to 1:00 AM EST
- The Tokyo and London overlap from 2:00 AM EST to 4:00 AM EST
- The London and New York overlap from 8:00 AM EST to 11:00 AM EST

NOTE: Due to daylight savings these times may adjust depending on whether it is summer and winter.

Trading during session overlaps can be the best time to trade as this is when price makes the largest moves. You have traders from both sessions making trades.

- The London - New York overlap is the best time to trade
- The Tokyo - London overlap tends to be slow as the Asian work day is wrapping up and Europe is just waking up
- The Sydney - Tokyo overlap is another good time to trade if you live in North America and want to trade in the evenings

Avoid trading from 5:00 PM EST to 7:00 PM EST. This has the lowest price movement of any time as really only New Zealand is trading at these times. When deciding which pairs to trade keep in mind that currencies are typically the most heavily traded during their respective countries' sessions.

So EUR/USD is best to trade during the London - New York overlap and EUR/JPY would be best to trade during the Tokyo - London overlap. AUD and NZD pairs can be good pairs to trade during the Tokyo and Sydney sessions.

## When Should you Trade?

In order of best times to trade Forex:

1. London - New York Overlap
2. London Session
3. New York Session
4. Tokyo - London Overlap
5. Tokyo - Sydney Overlap
6. Tokyo Session
7. Sydney Session

As stated earlier trading during an overlap is the ideal time to trade due to the increased liquidity and price movement. London is the closest thing forex has to a head or governing body. Almost half of all forex trading volume goes through London.

So trading anytime during the London session is a good idea. It also benefits from overlapping both with the Tokyo session and the New York session. Due to the immense trading volume during the London session you can pretty much trade any of the majors or minors with no problem.

The New York session has a ton of trading volume in the morning as it overlaps with the London session and slows down a little bit in the afternoon but still has plenty of liquidity and opportunities. Realistically you can trade any pairs during the New York session as there is plenty of trading volume.

The London and New York sessions account for the majority of forex trading volume and are the best times to trade as there will be the most opportunities. The Tokyo session is still a good time to trade as it represents about a fifth of all forex trading volume. Many people successfully trade the Tokyo session so don't worry too much if that is the only time you have available to trade.

Trading from 5:00 PM EST on Sunday until London open on Monday morning tends to be slow and Friday after London close also tends to be slow. It is not recommended to trade during these times as there will be low liquidity and few opportunities.

## Recommended Capital

Through the use of leverage you can trade forex with as little as $100. This makes it ideal for people interested in trading that do not have tens of thousands of dollars to put at risk.
