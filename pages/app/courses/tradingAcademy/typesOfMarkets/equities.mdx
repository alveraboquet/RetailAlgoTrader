# Equities Market

## Overview

In equities markets shares of companies are traded between different entities. More commonly known as stock markets. Stock markets are designed to allow companies to offer ownership of their company in return for your money.

Companies use the money raised from issuing shares of their company to invest in new infrastructure and projects. By owning a share you can share in the financial success of the company. However if the company does not do well you also share in their losses.

Companies that offer stock on the markets are known as public companies. The most well known stock exchanges in the world are the New York Stock exchange and NASDAQ. However, there are many smaller markets both domestically and internationally. Each country typically has their own stock markets for their local companies. However, you are not restricted to trading in your country's stock market. People from all over the world trade on the NYSE.

## Size of Market

The NYSE is the largest stock market exchange in the world. It has a market capitalization of roughly 27.2 trillion USD. The NASDAQ is very close at 22.4 trillion USD.

The third largest exchange is the Shanghai Stock Exchange at 7.4 trillion USD. As you can see NYSE and NASDAQ are by far the largest exchanges in the world.

## PDT

The Pattern Day Trader Rule applies to US traders who are trading on margin. If you are not a US citizen I do not believe this rule applies to you; however, you need to conduct your own research into your country's respective laws.

The PDT rule limits your ability to day trade if your account value is less than $25,000. If you execute more than 4 or more day trades in 5 business days your broker will classify you as a pattern day trader.

If you are classified as a pattern day trader you must be trading with a margin account that has a value of at least $25,000.Some US traders get around the PDT rule by using foreign brokers that do not enforce the PDT rule. However, this is strongly recommended against because this brokers tend to be unregulated and you can run into legal issues with the US government.

## When are Markets Open

The following information will apply to the NYSE. The core trading hours are 9:30 am to 4:00 pm EST. This is the recommended time to trade as trading volume is the greatest at this time.

Pre-trading hours are from 8:00 am to 9:30 am EST though some brokers offer earlier access. After-market hours are from 4:00 pm to 8:00 pm EST.

Pre-trading hours and after-market hours are typically not recommended for a typical trader. Trading volume is low and as a result it can be difficult to fulfill orders. As you become more advanced you can begin to look into extended hours trading.

See the following [link](https://www.nyse.com/markets/hours-calendars) for special hours and holidays that may affect market hours

## Recommended Capital

You can get started in the equities market with any amount of capital. Share prices can range from cents to thousands of dollars. Stocks that trade from cents to $5.00 or so are considered penny stocks. Trading these as a beginner is not recommended as they tend to be very volatile and unpredictable.

Many brokers not offer fractional shares so traders with little capital can trade expensive stocks. If you have less than $25,000 then you will want to primarily focus on long-term trading (holding trades for weeks, months, or years) and swing trading (holding trades for days to a week).

This is due to the Pattern Day Trader Rule which requires you to have $25,000 in capital in order to day trade. If you have $25,000 in capital (preferably $30,000 to give yourself a decent buffer) then you can day trade.
