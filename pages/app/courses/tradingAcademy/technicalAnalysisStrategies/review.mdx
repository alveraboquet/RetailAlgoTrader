# Review

- Do not obsess too much over these strategies
- Spend some time experimenting with these strategies on TradingView to see if they work with your trading personality.
- Spend some time backtesting (backtesting will be discussed in-depth) these strategies to learn when they work and when they do not work
- Feel free to modify these strategies with more advanced entry and exit rules. Add additional indicators to provide stronger trade signals. Etc
- These are not the holy grail of strategies. They are decent technical analysis strategies that provide a good starting point for you to develop your own profitable trading strategy portfolio.
- These strategies are not full-proof. They do not always work. Sometimes you will have the perfect setup and the trade will still turn out to be a loser. That is unfortunately part of trading.
