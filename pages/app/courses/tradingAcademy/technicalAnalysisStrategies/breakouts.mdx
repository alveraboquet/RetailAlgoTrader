# Breakouts

## Trendline Breakouts

The strategy discussed below combines trendlines with a chart pattern. The Trendline Breakout consists of a trendline in combination with the engulfing bar chart pattern.

This strategy aims to enter the trade at the beginning of a breakout from a trend. This strategy works well on really any timeframe but 4 hours and up provides the strongest signals.

Remember that a trendline should consist of at least three separate touch points to be a valid trendline. Do not force a trendline that should not be there.

## Long Signal

A long trading signal is triggered when price closes above a downward trendline and then is followed by a strong bullish engulfing bar.

## Short Signal

A short trading signal is triggered when price closes below an upward trendline and then is followed by a strong bearish engulfing bar.

## Exit Conditions

This strategy has a couple of exit conditions:

## When to Trade This Strategy

This strategy is ideal to use when price is trending. Breaking a strong trend frequently results in large price movements.

## When not to Trade This Strategy

This strategy does not perform well when price is ranging. When price is ranging it will form many weak trendlines that frequently break without resulting in a strong breakout move.

In a ranging market it would be better to use a mean reversion strategy.

1. A strong downward trendline is drawn with three touchpoints
2. A strong bullish engulfing bar breaks out of the trendline
3. Enter the trade at the close of the engulfing bar that broke out of the trendline
4. Set the stoploss just below the low of the engulfing bar
5. Set the take profit at a 1:2 risk:reward ratio (The TP should be twice as far from the entry price as the SL) (This technique will be discussed in-depth.
6. If you were to implement a trailing stop loss with this trade then your profit would have been massive

1. A strong upward trendline is drawn with four touch points
2. A strong bearish engulfing bar breaks the trendline
3. The trade is entered at the close of the engulfing candlestick
4. The stoploss is placed just above the high of the engulfing candlestick
5. The takeprofit is placed at a 1:2 risk:reward

## Potential Improvements

Remember these rules can be tweaked to fit your trading methodology and also the market.

- Let price breakout of the trendline and then return to test the trendline as resistance. This ensures that the trend is truly over and that a reversal is likely.
- Add RSI as an additional indicator to verify that the trend is likely to reverse.
- Add a trailing stop instead of a hard stop loss. This allows you to take full advantage of strong trends.
- Turn this into an algorithmic strategy that auto adjusts the take profits to track the Bollinger Bands so you do not have to sit there and watch the trade.
