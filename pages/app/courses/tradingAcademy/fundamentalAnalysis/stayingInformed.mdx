# Staying Informed of the Markets

While the vast majority of retail traders do not focus on fundamental analysis, it is still important to be aware of the
markets. For example if you have a strategy that performs well in low-volatility, ranging markets but a major economic
announcement is coming out it may be a good idea to sit out the announcement and wait for volatility to die down
before trading again.

There are many times when a trader will see a perfect technical setup, take the trade, and then watch in disappointment
as price shoots towards their stoploss. Then they sit there confused about what happened and begin to lost faith
in their trading system.

If they had just checked an economic calendary before opening their trade they would have realized that the company was about
to realize their earnings report. Periods of high volatility typically follow earnings reports and therefore it is a good
idea to stay out of the market unless you are a news trader.

Staying aware of the fundamentals is important even as a technical trader. The best way to do this is by checking an
economic calendar every morning.

For equities we recommend the [YahooFinance](https://finance.yahoo.com/calendar/) economic calendar. It is powered by
YahooFinance, one of the best free resources for trading info, and includes economic events as well as earnings reports.
When choosing a calendar for trading equities, options, or futures be sure to choose one that has earnings reports
as well.

For Forex we recommend the [DailyFX](https://www.dailyfx.com/economic-calendar) economic calendar. It is powered by IG, one
of the top Forex brokers, and allows you to filter by country and importance.

Regardless of your trading methodology it is a good habit to check the calendars every morning before beginning to trade.
This will ensure you are not blind-sided by any major news. As you become more advanced you can even begin to take
advantage of the news events to make significant profit.
