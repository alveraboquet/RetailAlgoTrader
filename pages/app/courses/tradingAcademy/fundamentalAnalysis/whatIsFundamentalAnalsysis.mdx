# What is Fundamental Analysis?

Fundamental analysis is the other primary category of trading strategies where technical analysis is the other.

Fundamental analysis focuses on the 'fundamentals' of the asset. These fundamentals consist of values such as inflation rates,
earning reports, valuation, etc. Each asset category has its own fundamentals.

Fundamental analysis is a much more time-intensive and resource-intensive set of strategies than technical analysis. With technical
analysis anybody with a TradingView account can place indicators on a chart and begin trading. Fundamental analysis requires
access to data sources and reports that may or may not be readily available to the public.

For example one of the most common reports evaluated by fundamental analysts is a company's 10-K. All publicly traded companies
are required to release 10-Ks that detail their recent financial performance. Analysts will use these reports to determine
if a company is overvalued, undervalued, debt-laden, cash-heavy, etc. All of these factors are evaluated to decide whether or
not the company is a good buy.

However Apple's most recent 10-K is 82 pages long. 82 pages of dense legal paragraphs and technical financial data. And that
is only one report. There are countless reports and government financial meetings that must be kept up with to be a quality
fundamental trader.

After all this research into Apple you may decide it is not a good buy. Now you have to start the entire process over again
for the next company. Whereas with technical analysis the strategies developed can be applied to any asset in any market.

Fundamental Analysis is less popular for these reasons:

- It requires extensive time and energy to research every trading decision
- Fundamentals are becoming increasingly less important in modern markets
- Research is specific to one asset in one market. It cannot be applied cross-asset or cross-market

Fundamental analysis is by no means useless. Fundamental traders can be just as successful if not more successful than
technical traders. Warren Buffett is the go-to example of a highly successful fundamental trader. However, he has access
to all of the best information and has a massive team to dissect reports and analyze a company's financial info. Most
retail traders do not have this.

Another huge issue with fundamental analysis is that it is extremely difficult to automate. Developing systems to automate
fundamental data gathering and analysis is outside of the abilities' of most retail traders.

Fundamental analysis can be very useful for long-term investing. However, for trading the majority of retail traders
stick with technical analysis.
