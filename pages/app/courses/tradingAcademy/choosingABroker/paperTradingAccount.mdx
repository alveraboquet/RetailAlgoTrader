# Setting up a Paper Trading Account

If you have not already set up a paper trading account we highly recommend you do so now. You know enough to begin developing
your own trading systems, to start backtesting, and to start practicing live trading. Nearly all brokers offer paper trading accounts;
however, most require you to open an account with them. If you are not interested in opening a brokerage account at this time, both
TradingView and QuantConnect offer paper trading without an active broker account.

## Paper Trading with TradingView

In order to open a paper trading account with TradingView navigate to their chart feature. At the bottom click Trading Panel
and a list of available brokers will open. The first one will be Paper Trading. Click that and you will be able to set up
a paper trading account.
