# Considerations for Choosing a Broker

When you select a broker you are putting a lot of faith in their ability to properly and ethically handle your money. This is
why it is so important to choose a broker with a good reputation and one that is part of a proper regulatory agency.

RobinHood is a new broker that has made no-fee trading popular. In addition, it has attracted thousands of young people
to day trading and investing. However, during Covid 2020 - 2021 RobinHood ran into some huge scandals. If you have been at all involved
in the markets you have definitely heard of the GameStop squeeze. Since RobinHood offers no-fee trading they need to make
revenue somehow. RobinHood does this through payment for order flow. Payment for order flow means that Robinhood takes all of
the data from your account (open trades, trading patterns, account balances, etc) and sells it to hedge funds and data
conglomerates.

This is a questionable practice that is actually undergoing review by the SEC currently. However, even if you ignore the ethics
of this practice, payment for order flow presents another issue. RobinHood's customers are not you. RobinHood's customers are the
hedge funds that are buying your data. So during 2021 when Gamestop and other stocks such as AMC began to squeeze, [RobinHood
was pressured by Hedge Funds to cut off retail trader access to the stocks] (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-interactive-brokers-restrict-trading-in-gamestop-s.html).
People were unable to buy these stocks and many lost out on significant money. Not to mention that RobinHood worked with
Hedge Funds to disrupt the very foundation of a free market (not a new thing by the way).

RobinHood and other brokers that took part in this scandal claim it was due to the increased volatility of these stocks and the
goal was to protect investors. There may be some truth to this but the majority of people agree that it benefited the hedge
funds much more than these brokers' investors.

This is an extreme example but it does represent the importance of carefully choosing your broker. Avoid recent brokers aimed at
retail traders like RobinHood and Webull. These brokers have strong financial ties to Hedge Funds, regulatory agencies are still
struggling to properly manage these firms, and these firms simply do not have a strong history of protecting retail trader's
accounts. [RobinHood recently settled a lawsuit] (https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/robinhood-agrees-settle-customer-lawsuit-over-2020-outages-2022-05-27/)
over its' Covid trading outages.

Unfortunately RobinHood was not the only broker caught in this scandal, others such as Interactive Brokers restricted trading
of Gamestop and other stocks. Interactive Brokers also takes part in the practice of Payment for Order Flow. It is best to play
it safe and choose a reputable broker that has a strong history of industry best practices. It is tough to escape the payment
for order flow business model and many reputable brokers such as Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade use it. At the time of
writing Fidelity is one of the few brokers that does not participate in the payment for order flow business model.

There are many factors to consider when choosing a broker. A few key factors to consider are listed below.

## Assets Offered

Most brokers specialize in one or a set of assets. For example, Fidelity is aimed at equities, mutual funds, and options.
Coinbase is aimed at cryptocurrencies. Oanda is aimed at forex. Choosing your broker will be mostly determined by
what assets you decide to trade.

## Is it Regulated?

Depending on the markets there will be different regulatory agencies. For the US equities market there is the
[The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)](https://www.finra.org/#/). For the US futures market and forex
there is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the National Futures Association(NFA).

Before opening an account with a broker ensure that they are licensed and regulated by one of the above organizations or a
similar organization. The above regulatory agencies are aimed at US markets and citizens. However, there are similar governmental
agencies in other countries. For example, the UK has the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) which IG (a popular forex broker) is
regulated by.

## Spreads vs Fixed Commissions

When trading equities, your broker will typically have a no transaction cost model making this point irrelevant.

When trading options or futures, many brokers still charge a commission fee per contract. However, some are beginning to
offer the no transaction cost model for these assets as well.

The remainder of this discussion will be in regards to Forex. As a non-centralized market, Forex has a few additional details
unique to it that need to be reviewed. Forex brokers use three models for making money: fixed spreads, variable spreads, and
commission. A spread is simply the difference between the bid and ask price. So if the difference between the bid and ask
price of EURUSD is 3 pips then the spread will be 3 pips. This also means that your transaction costs for the trade will be
3 pips.

Recognize that in Forex zero commission does not mean zero transaction cost. Instead of paying a commission you pay your transaction
fee through spreads. In equities many of the brokers genuinly offer zero transaction cost trading.

### Fixed Spreads

With the fixed spread model, traders always pay a set spread regardless of market conditions. The benefit of this is that you
can accurately predict what your transaction costs will be. The disadvantage is that in fast moving markets you will experience
frequent requotes as well as slippage. Requotes occur when price is moving too quickly so by the time your order goes through
to the market maker your broker can no longer offer the set spread. A requore is sent to you and you have to resubmit your
order.

Slippage occurs when you submit an order but your broker cannot submit the order at your designated price while honoring the
set spread. As a result, your order is submitted at a different price. Obviously you do not want your broker determining
your order's entry price. When using a fixed spread broker, traders must implement strong requote and slippage controls.

Fixed spread brokers are not recommended for novice traders. Fixed spread brokers can be very useful for algorithmic traders
with strategies that make frequent trades. They can create algorithms to automatically handle requotes and slippage. In addition,
one of the biggest threats to high frequency traders are transaction costs. Their trades typically have a small amount of profit.
It is essential that they are able to accurately predict transaction costs. For longer term strategies such as multi hour and up
fixed spreads do not offer much benefit.

### Variable Spreads

The variable spread model means that the spread offered by brokers changes according to market conditions. So if the markets
are highly volatile or if liquidity for an asset is low the spread will be high. This high transaction cost discourages trading
until the markets cool down. If the markets have low volatility and there is a high level of liquidity spreads will be very
low.

Variable spread brokers are by far the most popular brokers in Forex. This is also the model that we recommend for beginner
traders. The brokers constantly compete with each other to offer the lowest spreads. In addition requotes and slippage are
a much smaller issue than with fixed spreads.

Variable spreads work well for longer-term strategies as the transaction cost is spread out over a large time period. The
transaction cost tends to be irrelevant when compared to the P/L of the trade.

### Commission

Brokers with the traditional commission model are not very common for retail forex traders. This model charges a set dollar amount
per trade. These transaction costs can add up very quickly and as a result it is not recommended.

Really the only time you should consider a commission based broker as a retail trader is if you are purely a news trader. During
high-impact news events spreads widen, slippage increases, and requotes increases. All of these factors make the fixed spread
and variable spread models not ideal.

## Market Makers vs ECNs

As we have previously discussed, the Forex market is a decentralized, global market. There is no central exhange that determines
price. As a result, the price of assets can vary from broker to broker. Market makers and ECNs take the place of a centralized
exchange. They facilitate the connection of buyers and sellers so that fast, low-cost trading is available for retail traders.

### Market Makers

Market makers offer assets at a certain bid and ask price. The difference between their set bid and ask prices is the spread
that we discussed earlier. Market makers are free to set their own bid and ask prices; however, the large amount of competition
in the market tends to keep spreads low. When you trade with a market maker you are actually trading against the market maker. For example, when you submit a buy order
for EURUSD the market maker must take the opposite sell order.

This seems to present a clear conflict of interest as the market maker is simultaneously managing your order fulfillment while
trading against you. When your trade is profitable you make money and the market maker loses money. And in the past there have
certainly been issues with market makers. For example, market makers would adjust the spread of an asset if there was a large
collection of stoplosses. If you are a consistently profitable traders some market makers will actually copy your trades to
increase their profits.

However, that being said in today's forex markets there is very little manipulation due to strong regulation. There are many
reputable brokers that use the market maker model. Do not let the fear of market manipulation steer you away from market
maker brokers.

Market makers were developed to increase liquidity and ease of trading. Brokers that use market makers are easy to use and offer
many features to help your trading. In addition, with market maker based brokerages you can pretty much always buy and sell
any asset at a reasonable price. Without market makers, retail trading would be extremely difficult. The majority of retail
forex brokers have their own in-house market makers or are partnered with a market maker.

#### Pros

- Easy to use and feature-rich trading platforms
- Better liquidity
- Allows greater access to the markets for retail traders

#### Cons

- Past issues with conflict of interest (Not really an issue anymore)
- Trade execution depends on the market maker. If the market maker's systems go down you are out of luck.

### ECNs

Electronic communication networks (ECNs) collect prices from a variety of market participants. These market participants
consist of banks, market makers, retail traders, etc. The bid and ask price of the asset is determined by the collection of
prices.

During times of high liquidity and low volatility this can even result in zero spread. However, during times of low liquidity or
high volatility the spread can skyrocket. Remember that ECNs do not set the price. So in order to buy or sell an asset the ECN
must have another trader willing to conduct a transaction at the same bid and ask price. Unlike market makers, the ECN is not
taking the trade opposite of you. It is connecting your order to another entity such as a bank or another retail trader
that takes the opposite order. This eliminates any risk of market manipulation.

ECNs frequently work on a commission based model. Their logic is that they pull prices from a wide variety of sources and thus
can get you the lowest possible spread. Trading on an ECN is not recommended for beginner traders. Their trading platforms are
usually not very user-friendly and they do not offer many of the features that market-maker based platforms offer.

ECNs are aimed at institutional traders and more advanced retail algorithmic traders. The increased flexibility of ECNs allows
knowledgble traders to increase their profits and also opens up additional strategies. For example, retail traders can actually
act as market makers through ECN brokers. In this strategy the trader is market neutral and makes their profit off of spreads.

#### Pros

- Price is gathered from many sources and is frequently betten than that offered by a market maker
- No conflict of interest on trade management
- Offers more flexibility

#### Cons

- Trading platforms are not user-friendly
- Managing orders especially stoplosses and takeprofits is more difficult
- Usually commissions charged for trades
