# Forex Lot Sizing Formula

This lesson is optional for those who have no interest in trading Forex. We include this lesson as many people prefer to trade
forex. Through leverage Forex allows people with little capital to begin trading. However, forex trades in pairs which can
make risk management and price changes difficult to calculate. Unlike stocks which trade in number of shares, Forex trades
in lots. A lot is 1 unit of a currency pair.

There will be some other terms in this lesson such as pips that you may not understand. If you have no interest in trading
Forex feel free to just skip this lesson. If you are interested in learning more about Forex check out our Forex with MT4
course.

## Calculating Lot Size in Forex

Before being able to properly determine your trade's lot size you will need to decide the entry price for your trade
and the stoploss for your trade. Without first determining the location of your stoploss the formula will be unable to
calculate the proper lot size.

The formula for calculating proper lot size in Forex is as follows:

Account Risk ($) / (Trade Risk in pips x Pip Value)

Let's assume you have a $100,000 account and are risking 1% per trade. According to your risk management trade you can risk
$1,000 per trade. Lets assume that you are going long on EURUSD. You want to enter the trade at 1.1300 and you want to place
your stoploss at 1.1200. You are risking 100 pips.

The last value you need to determine is pip value. Calculating pip value is difficult and confusing. For EURUSD the pip value
is $0.10 for a micro lot, $1 for a mini lot, and $10 for a standard lot.

### Lot Size with Micro Lots

If you choose to trade micro lots here is what your formula would look like:

$1,000 / (100 pips x $0.10) = 100 micro lots

Micro lots are typically the smallest lot unit that brokers offer. They are equivalent to 1,000 units of currency. They are
designed for traders with less capital such as $10,000 or less. In this case with $100,000 in capital it makes more sense
to trade mini lots.

### Lot Size with Mini Lots

If you choose to trade mini lots here is what your formula would look like:

$1,000 / (100 pips x $1) = 10 mini lots

10 mini lots is the same as 100 micro lots. It really does not matter which size you choose to trade; however, most traders
try to keep their lot size under 100 whether that be micro, mini, or standard lots. Mini lots are equivalent to 10,000 units
of currency. They are designed for traders with capital ranging from $100,000 to $10,000.

### Lot Size with Standard Lots

If you choose to trade standard lots here is what your formula would look like:

$1,000 / (100 pips x $10) = 1 standard lot

Standard lots are typically the largest lot size available to trade. These are designed for heavily-funded and professional
traders.

## Lot Size Calculator

We absolutely do not recommend that you attempt to hand calculate your lot size everytime you make a trade. It is much too
easy to make an error and end up losing more than you intended.

Instead you should use a position size calculator. One of our favorites is the (BabyPips Calculator)
[https://www.babypips.com/tools/position-size-calculator]. Account Currency is simple the currency you hold in your account.
For US citizens this would be USD.
