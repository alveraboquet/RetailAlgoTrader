# Kelly Criterion Method

The Kelly Criterion method is another risk management strategy that has seen a surge in popularity recently. This method
aims to determine the best risk percentage based on your odds of a winning trade. The goal of Kelly Criterion is pure capital
growth. While this seems great it can actually raise many issues.

Frequently a portfolio using Kelly Criterion will have long drawdowns. This can be an issue if you are planning on using
the money from your portfolio anytime soon. In addition, it is very difficult psychological to watch a long drawdown.

Kelly Criterion frequently fails because traders are not prepared for a long drawdown. The drawdown occurs and they lose faith
in the system. Kelly Criterion requires traders to stick with the system through long drawdowns and eventually grow their
capital.

We do NOT recommend using Kelly Criterion. While it is better than Martingale, it still has the issue of risking too much
capital on individual trades.

## Kelly Criterion Formula

The Kelly Criterion formula is as follows.

Kelly % = W - [(1 - W) / R]

- W: Historical win percentage of strategy
- R: Historical win/loss ratio of strategy

W is simply the percentage of trades won. R is the size of the average winning trade divided by the size of the average
losing trade.

## Kelly Criterion Example 1

Let's assume that you have a historical win percentage of 60% and a historical win/loss ratio of 2:1.

Kelly % = .6 - [(1 - .6) / 2] = .4 = 40%

In this situation the Kelly Criterion is recommending that how risk 40% of your capital. This is because your strategy has
a good win percentage and a good win/loss ratio. With the primary goal of capital growth Kelly Criterion recommends a very
large risk percentage to try and maximize profits.

However, 40% risk per trade is a ton. If this trade is a loss you will lose almost half of your capital. If you have
backtested properly and calculated your metrics correctly then in theory over the long term risking 40% of your capital per
trade should maximize gains. It is evident though how a small mistake in backtesting or calculations could cause you to lose
significant money very quickly. It may not even be a mistake on your part. The market conditions may just shift and now your
calculated win percantage and win/loss ratio are no longer accurate.

## Kelly Criterion Example 2

Let's assume that you have a historical win percentage of 45% and a historical win/loss ratio of 1.25:1.

Kelly % = .45 - [(1 - .45) / 1.25] = .01 = 1%

In this situation the Kelly Criterion is recommending that how risk 1% of your capital. This is because your strategy has
a poor win percentage and a poor win/loss ratio.

## How to Calculate W and R

In order to determine W and R for the formula you need a significant history of trades. This is where backtesting is used.
Traders will step back through days, months, or even years to test their strategy on past markets. They see where they would
have entered a trade and how the trade would have performed. All of this info is recorded and then analyzed. Backtesting has
an entire chapter dedicated to it later in this course.

Using all of this past data traders can calculate an expected win percentage and expected win/loss ratio to be used in
the Kelly Criterion formula. However, the issue with this method is that the markets are constantly changing. While historically
your strategy may have a win percentage of 60% and a win/loss ratio of 2:1, in current market conditions it may actually
have a win percentage of 45% and a win/loss ration of 1.25:1.

This is always a risk with backtesting. Historical performance does not guarantee future performance. With a good backtesting
methodology and proper risk management you can recognize when your strategy is not performing as expected before losing
significant capital. However, with Kelly Criterion it is possible to lose a lot of money before you realize that your
strategy is not performing as expected.

## Conclusion

We do NOT recommend the Kelly Criterion method when trading. While some advanced traders are able to use it successfully,
it is very risky for beginner or intermediate traders to use. Small mistakes or changes in market conditions can be
disastrous.
