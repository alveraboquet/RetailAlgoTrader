# Why is Risk Management Important?

So far in this course we have learned about a variety of topics:

- Types of markets
- Margin TradingView
- Reading a Chart
- Indicators and Chart Patterns
- Types of Analysis

However, this next topic is perhaps the most important.

Proper risk management is the key to long-term profitability. Risk management is the technique to determining how much capital
to risk per trade. Nothing will blow up your account quicker than lack of a solid risk management strategy.

Hopefully you have caught on by now that trading is difficult and far from an exact science. No matter how good of a trader
you are you will have many losing trades. Your risk management strategy is in place to ensure that these losing trades
do not wipe out the profits from your winning trades.

## Preserve Capital

When you enter the market your goal should not be to make lots of profit. Your goal should be to not lose the capital
you are starting out with. If you are able to trade and just breakeven you are already doing better than the majority
of traders.

Once you have reached the ability to trade for any length of time while preserving your capital, taking the extra step
to consistent profitability is easy. Remember that if you focus on protecting your trading capital the profits will come
on their own.

### Example

The reason that preserving capital is so important is because saving money is so much easier than making back money
that you have lost. Many traders do not grasp the concept that if they lose 10% of their capital they need to then
make back more than 10% of their capital just to get back to where they started.

Lets look at the example below. You have developed your own trading signal. All of the indicators line up and Reddit is
telling you it is a sure trade. So you decide to make a big trade to maximize profits. You risk 20% of your capital ($100,000)
in this example.

But you were not paying attention to your economic calendar and the company released a below expectations earnings report. The
stock drops and you sure winner turns into a loser. As you risked 20% of your $100,000 you now have $80,000.

Once again your trading system provides an entry signal. You decide to risk 20% to get your money back. This time your trade
is a winner but when you check your account balance it is only at $96,000. Because you now only have $80,000 in capital you
only profited $16,000.

| Starting Capital | Percent Risked | P/L       | Remaining Capital |
| ---------------- | -------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| $100,000         | 20%            | -$20,0000 | $80,0000          |
| $80,000          | 20%            | $16,000   | $96,000           |

If you wanted to get back to your starting capital of $100,000 you would have to risk 25%. Preserving capital is always
easier than making it back.
