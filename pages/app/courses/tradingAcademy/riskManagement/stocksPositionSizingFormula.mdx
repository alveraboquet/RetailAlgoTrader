# Equities Position Sizing Formula

Determining the proper position size with equities is fairly straightforward.

## Calculating Position Size in Equities

Before being able to properly determine your trade's position size you just need to decide your risk percentage and your trade
risk per share. Your trade risk per share comes from your stoploss.

If you want to enter the trade at $50 and place your stoploss at $45 your trade risk per share is $5.

The formula for calculating proper position size in stocks is as follows:

Account Risk ($) / Trade Risk ($)

Let's assume you have a $100,000 account and are risking 1% per trade. According to your risk management trade you can risk
$1,000 per trade. Your trade risk per share is $5.

$1,000 / $5 = 200 shares

By only risking 1% of your account your position size will be 200 shares. Now keep in mind that at $50 per share and a trade
size of 200 shares this trade will cost you $10,000 to open without margin. With your stoploss at $45 you can only lose $1,000
of that $10,000 but you need to ensure that you have sufficient capital to actually open this trade.

Trading in a margin account (required for day traders) allows you to purchase more shares with less capital. In the US most
margin accounts offer 2:1 leverage. Meaning that to open our previous example you would only need $5,000 in available capital
to open the trade. Your broker would provide the other $5,000.

## Position Size Calculator

We absolutely do not recommend that you attempt to hand calculate your position size everytime you make a trade. It is much too
easy to make an error and end up losing more than you intended.

Instead you should use a position size calculator. One of our favorites is the (ChartYourTrade.com)

## Multiple Trades Open at Once

Depending on your strategy you may have multiple trades open at once. For the most part this does not affect the position
size strategy. You should still calculate your percent risked based on your account value which will include all cash
and all open trade values.

Here are a couple of instances where it could affect your position size strategy:

1. You are trading on a margin account

- In a margin account if you have too much of your capital tied up in open trades you can receive a margin call
- This is not an issue with a cash account; however, you still want to ensure you have enough capital not tied up in
  trades to allow your trades to breath.

2. You are trading similar assets

- Assets that trade similarly are considered to be correlated
- We will discuss correlation in-depth in a couple of lessons
- For now just understand that risking 2% each on two correlated assets is essentially the same as risking 4% on one
  asset. This is because the correlated assets move the same. If one is a losing trade the other will also be a losing trade.
