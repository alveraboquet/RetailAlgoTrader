# What is Correlation?

There are thousands of different assets out there to trade. However, that does not mean there are thousands of unique trades
to be made. Many assets move almost identically to each other. For example, Gold and Silver tend to move in the same direction
at the same time. AUDUSD and NZDUSD tend to move together. BTC and ETH usually move together. Large tech stocks will frequently
all move together.

These are all examples of correlation. If two different assets move very similarly then they are correlated. Correlation is
calculated on a scale of -1.0 to 1.0. -1.0 means the two assets will always move opposite of each other. 1.0 means the two
assets will always move the exact same. 0 means there is no correlation between assets.

If a correlation value is between -0.5 and 0.5 it is safe to consider these assets as non-correlated. When calculating correlation
coefficients you should use a timeframe that is representative of the timeframe you are trading. If you are a day trader then
you should check the daily or even hourly correlation of the assets. If you hold trades for a week then you should check the
monthly correlation of the assets.

For example AUDUSD and NZDUSD have a correlation value of 0.99 when looking at the past year. Trading AUDUSD is essentially
the same as trading NZDUSD and vice versa.

## How does Correlation affect your Risk Management Strategy?

Correlation can have a huge impact on your risk management strategy and many traders fail to realize this. As we have emphasized
throughout this chapter it is important to set a percent risked per trade. Let's say that you have chosen 2%. A freak storm
has hit Saudi Arabia's refinery facilities wiping out their production long-term. This causes the stock prices of US-based
oil companies Shell, BP, and Exxon to jump upward.

Your trading system issues three buy signals: one for Shell, one for BP, and one for Exxon. Per your risk management strategy
you issue buy orders for each stock with each order risking 2% of your capital. However right after you issue your buy orders,
the US president issues an executive order banning all offshore oil rigs. The stock prices of Shell, BP, and Exxon all
immediately drop.

All three of your orders end up hitting the stop loss. Instead of losing 2% you end up losing 6%. This is how correlation
can affect your risk management strategy. By opening three orders of 2% on three heavily correlated stocks you might as well
have risked 6% on just one of these stocks.

If your trading strategy issues trade signals for correlated assets it is best to just trade one asset at a time. This ensures
that you are not risking too much on assets that move very similarly.

## Correlation Example

In the image below we can see the stock prices for Shell, BP, and Exxon-Mobil all on the same chart.

It is very evident that over the past month these stocks have moved almost identically. The purple lines on the chart
demonstrate how all three stocks peak and bottom at exactly the same time. These stocks are highly correlated.

## Correlation Calculator

Calculating correlation values is difficult and unnecessary. There are multiple calculators online that automate this
process for you.

### Stock Correlation Calculator

For stocks our favorite correlation calculator is (PortfolioVisualizer)[https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/asset-correlations].
You can input a list of tickers separated by commas and it will return the correlation values. For example inputting SHEL, BP,
and TSLA reveals that SHEL and BP have a 0.89 correlation value over the past month. SHEL and TSLA have a 0.36 correlation
which indicates you can trade both SHEL and TSLA without worrying about correlation.

### Forex Correlation Calculator

For forex our favorite correlation calculator is (myfxbook)[https://www.myfxbook.com/forex-market/correlation]. It allows
you to save your most frequently traded pairs and select a timeframe for calculating the correlation coefficient.

## Conclusion

When trading multiple assets at the same time it is important to doublecheck the correlation between the assets. In this lesson
we focused on the risks of trading correlated assets. However, correlation also provides many trading opportunities that we
will explore in later chapters.
