# The Slow Death

In the previous lesson we looked at how making lost money back is much more difficult than just preserving your existing
capital.

In this lesson we are going to expand on that lesson at look at one of the most common causes of trader failure.

Trading is really a simple game of mathematical probabilities. You are always going to have winning and losing trades. So
your job as a trader is to ensure that you have:

1. More winners than losers
2. Your winners are larger than your losers
3. Your strategy can survive a sustained drawdown

If you satisfy these three rules you will not only preserve your capital but make significant proftis over the long term.
Over the long term is the key there. Even the best of traders experience a series of losing trades which is known as
a drawdown. Having a proper risk managment strategy ensures that your trading capital can survive a serious drawdown
and keep you in the game.

## Winning Percentage

Your winning percentage is the percentage of trades that are profitable. Really this number should be greater than 50%.
We will look at a couple of examples below to see how winning percentage affects long-term profitability. In all of these
examples every trade risks 5% of your capital and we are using a 1:1 Risk:Reward Ratio.

### Winning Percentage of 25%

As you can see having a low winning percentage very quickly drains your capital. After 100 trades you would only have
$5,917 left.

### Winning Percentage of 50%

    height={2318}
    width={1496}
    alt=""
  />
  <figcaption>50% Win Percentage</figcaption>
</figure>

As you can see even a 50% winning percentage can slowly bleed capital. After 100 trades you would have $79.832. Again this
is because it is more difficult to make back lost money than it is to conserve your current capital.

### Winning Percentage of 52%

<figure>
  <Image
    src="/images/courses/tradingAcademy/riskManagement/52Percent.webp"
    height={2324}
    width={1506}
    alt=""
  />
  <figcaption>52% Win Percentage</figcaption>
</figure>

As you can see a 52% winning percentage results in profitability. There was even a significant drawdown from trade 30 to
trade 50 where your capital actually dropped all the way to $59,000. However, because you have a winning percentage greater than
50% you will be profitable over the long term.

### Winning Percentage of 75%

<figure>
  <Image
    src="/images/courses/tradingAcademy/riskManagement/75Percent.webp"
    height={2332}
    width={1504}
    alt=""
  />
  <figcaption>75% Win Percentage</figcaption>
</figure>

A 75% win percentage resulted in massive profits. There were almost now drawdowns. This graph is the ideal equity curve.
However, creating a strategy with a long-term win percentage of 75% is very difficult. If your equity curve does not
look like this that it is okay. It is an unrealistic expectation for beginner traders.

## Risk:Reward Ratio

Your risk:reward ratio is how much you risk per trade vs how much you stand to gain per trade. It is really as simple as
having your stoploss closer to your entry price than your take profit. You should typically always have a risk:reward ratio
greater than 1. This will ensure that your winners are bigger than your losers.

If you have an extremely high winning percentage than having a risk:reward ratio less than 1 is possible. However, starting
out your strategy should have a risk:reward ratio greater than 1.

In the following examples all trades have a risk percentage of 5% and win percentage of 50%.

### 0.5 Risk:Reward

<figure>
  <Image
    src="/images/courses/tradingAcademy/riskManagement/0.5RR.webp"
    height={2334}
    width={1508}
    alt=""
  />
  <figcaption>0.5 Risk:Reward</figcaption>
</figure>

In this example your winning trades make half as much as your losing trades lose. Clearly a R:R less than 1 results
in massive losses.

### 1 Risk:Reward

<figure>
  <Image
    src="/images/courses/tradingAcademy/riskManagement/50Percent.webp"
    height={2318}
    width={1496}
    alt=""
  />
  <figcaption>1 Risk:Reward</figcaption>
</figure>

This example is the same as the above example for 50% win percentage. As we can see a 1 R:R is not enough to ensure
profitability. The winning trades are not large enough to overcome the losing the trades.

### 2 Risk:Reward

<figure>
  <Image
    src="/images/courses/tradingAcademy/riskManagement/2RR.webp"
    height={2314}
    width={1504}
    alt=""
  />
  <figcaption>2 Risk:Reward</figcaption>
</figure>

A 2 R:R results in massive profitability. Your winners are twice as large as your losers. This is why it is so important
to keep your risk:reward ratio greater than 1.

## Percent Risked

Percent risked is how much capital you are going to risk per trade. This should be a set percentage that is risked for
every trade.

Starting out you should aim for 1% or 2% per trade. As you become more skilled this can be increased to 5%. However you
need to be cautious about going above 5% as sustained drawdowns can wipe out your capital if your risk percentage is too
high.

For each of the examples below the risk:reward ratio will be 1 and the win percentage will be 50%.

### 1% Risk Per Trade

<figure>
  <Image
    src="/images/courses/tradingAcademy/riskManagement/1PercentRisk.webp"
    height={2340}
    width={1512}
    alt=""
  />
  <figcaption>1% Risk Per Trade</figcaption>
</figure>

This example does a fantastic job of demonstrating how a low percent risked per trade allows you to survive a drawdown.
From trade 30 to 60 there was a massive streak of losing trades. However, because you were risking a small percentage your
account was able to recover and you only lost $12,000.

While this result is obviously not ideal, having an intelligent risk management strategy ensured that a streak of losers
could not wipe out your account.

### 5% Risk Per Trade

<figure>
  <Image
    src="/images/courses/tradingAcademy/riskManagement/50Percent.webp"
    height={2318}
    width={1496}
    alt=""
  />
  <figcaption>5% Risk Per Trade</figcaption>
</figure>

This example is very similar to the 1% risk per trade example. Since you are risking more per trade your overall loses are
larger; however, you were still able to survive some drawdowns.

### 20% Risk Per Trade

<figure>
  <Image
    src="/images/courses/tradingAcademy/riskManagement/20PercentRisk.webp"
    height={2354}
    width={1508}
    alt=""
  />
  <figcaption>20% Risk Per Trade</figcaption>
</figure>

This example demonstrates the issue with risking too much per trade. You never want your equity curve to reflect this example.
The choppy, massive peaks and valleys indicate that you are risking too much. When you risk a lot per trade it only takes
a couple of losing trades in a row to blow up your account. And you will inevitable experience a streak of losing trades.

If you want to survive long-term in the markets you need to ensure that your account can survive a sustained streak of
losing trades.

## Realistic Risk Management strategy

The below example demonstrates a good starting risk management strategy. The positive risk:reward ensures your winners
are larger than your losers. The greater than 50% win percentage ensures long-term profitability. The 2% risk per trade
ensures your strategy can survive drawdowns.

<figure>

    height={2330}
    width={1500}
    alt=""

The equity curve reflected in this example is what you should aim for. It is a smooth, consistent upward curve.

## Conclusion

Hopefully you know have an understanding of how win percentage, risk:reward ratio, and percent risked all directly affect
profitability. In addition hopefully you should now have a grasp of how these three metrics are interconnected.

The examples above use Coghlan Capital's (Trade Return Calculator)[https://coghlancapital.com/trade-return-calculator/].
Spend some time experimenting with the calculator in order to gain a better understanding of risk management.

An absolutely fascinating story is the study of the Medallion Fund. One of the most successful hedge funds of all time.
Allegedly their trades only have a 50.75% success rate. This demonstrates how through a proper understanding of risk
management you can create a slight edge and exploit that edge for significant profitability. If you want to learn more
about the Medallion Fund I highly recommend Gregory Zuckerman's book (The Man Who Solved the Market)[https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Solved-Market-Revolution/dp/073521798X/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=].

Now if you are experienced with statistics you may recognize that all of these examples would be different everytime
you run the situation. While the overall result will typically be the same there can be some significant variation in
how we get there.

For example if you were to run the 50% win percentage example multiple times some would be profitable and some would not
be profitable.

This leads to the study of Monte Carlo analysis which we will discuss in the next couple of lessons. Basically Monte Carlo
analysis would take each of these examples and run them multiple times to see how randomness in the losing or winning
trades will affect the outcome.
