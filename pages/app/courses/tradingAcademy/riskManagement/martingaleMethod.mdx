# The Martingale Method

The Martingale method is an extremely risky risk management strategy developed by Paul Pierre Levy, a French mathematician.
The Martingale method requires you to double your trade size every time a trade is a loss.

We do NOT recommend using the Martingal method. The only reason we even discuss it is so that if you stumble across it
you understand the immense risks associated with this technique.

## How to Trade using Martingale

The idea behind the Martingale method is simple. Everytime you have a losing trade your next trade should double the position
size. If you win you have made all of your money back plus some profit. If you lose you again double your position size.

This technique can actually work well in situations where winning and losing is an equal probability. However, winning and
losing is not at all an equal probability in the markets. At some point while trading you will encounter a streak of losing
trades. If you are using the Martingale method a streak of losers will blow up your account very quickly.

## Martingale Example with Coin Flip

In the example below we explore how the Martingale method works with a simple coin flip and a risk of 2%.

<div className="postTable">

| Trade Number | Account Balance | Percent Risked | $ Risked | W/L | New Balance |
| ------------ | --------------- | -------------- | -------- | --- | ----------- |
| 1            | 100.00          | 2              | 2.00     | L   | 98.00       |
| 2            | 98.00           | 4              | 3.92     | L   | 94.08       |
| 3            | 94.08           | 8              | 7.53     | W   | 101.61      |
| 4            | 101.61          | 2              | 2.03     | L   | 99.57       |

</div>

As you can see trades 1 and 2 were losses. As a result the percent risked double each time. On trade 3 we are risking 8% and
finally get a win. We make all of our money back plus a profit of $1.61. The next trade resets and we only risk 2%.

Martingale worked here because a coin flip has a 50% probability of being a win. It is a decent bet to assume that your
wins and losses will be roughly the same.

## Martingale Example in the Markets

In the example below we explore how the Martingale method works when trading in the markets with a risk of 2%.

<div className="postTable">

| Trade Number | Account Balance | Percent Risked | $ Risked | W/L | New Balance |
| ------------ | --------------- | -------------- | -------- | --- | ----------- |
| 1            | 100.00          | 2              | 2.00     | L   | 98.00       |
| 2            | 98.00           | 4              | 3.92     | L   | 94.08       |
| 3            | 94.08           | 8              | 7.53     | L   | 86.55       |
| 4            | 86.55           | 16             | 13.85    | L   | 72.71       |
| 5            | 72.71           | 32             | 23.27    | L   | 49.44       |
| 6            | 49.44           | 64             | 31.64    | L   | 17.80       |
| 7            | 17.80           | ?              | ?        | ?   | ?           |

</div>

As you can see all it took was 6 losing trades in a row to lose nearly all of your capital. After 6 losing trades you can no longer
double the risk percentage and you have no money left. This is why you should absolutely not use Martingale while trading.
During your time trading you will almost definitely experience a streak of losing trades that is at least 6 trades long.

Some people have attempted to modify Martingale method for the markets; however, the core issue of too much risk is inherent
in all of these attempts.

## Conclusion

Do NOT use Martingale to trade the markets. All it takes is a small losing streak to wipe out your account.
