# Trading the News

One of the most popular strategies when it comes to fundamental analysis is trading the news.

News traders will pay very close attention to their economic calendars. Before beginning the trading day these traders will
review any earnings reports or any major economic announcements.

Typically when a major news event occurs there is a large price movement. Some traders attempt to quickly review the report and
anticipate which direction price will jump. Using python web scrapping can greatly speed up this process. Other traders simply
wait for the movement to start and then ride it to profitability.

Below we will look at two of the most common news trading strategies. We focus on these two strategies as they are easier
for beginners to execute. You do not need comprehensive understanding of financial reports and economic science for these
strategies.

In both of these strategies we specify rules for entry and exit. However the overall trading strategies of straddles and
fades are the important part. The specific entry and exit rules can be modified to fit your trading style.

## The Straddle

The Straddle is what is considered a neutral position. This strategy is great if you have no idea which direction price
is going to go. With this strategy you want to focus on high impact news events as this strategy requires significant
volatility to be profitable. For this strategy you will want to focus on short time frames and price moves very quickly
with news events. 5m or less is ideal.

30 minutes before the news event you will want to draw two lines that encompass the recent price action range. The upper
boundary will be your bullish entry and the lower boundary will be your bearish entry. During a news event price can move
very quickly so we will want to use stop orders for our entry. Stop orders work well because we only want to enter the
trade if price breaks out of the range we defined. Limit orders will not work in this situation as they would cause us
to enter the trade before price breaks out of the range. Some brokers offer a stop-limit order that combines the best
of both orders and minimizes risk. However, this is an advanced topic so we will just stick with stop orders for now.

For both the bullish and bearish entry you should place the stoploss midway between the upper and lower boundary of the
initial range. This gives the trade enough room to breathe but if price fails to make a large breakout it will allow
you to exit the trade before taking a large loss.

For the bullish take profit you will want to set it at a distance above the upper range boundary equal to the distance
from the upper boundary to the lower boundary of the range. If price makes a jump up and breaks out of our defined range
it typically continues jumping up for quite a bit.

For the bearish take profit you will want to set it at a distance below the lower range boundary equal to the distance
from the upper boundary to the lower boundary of the range. If price drops and breaks out of our defined range
it typically continues dropping for quite a bit.

Then you wait for the news to release. Typically this will cause a large price movement the will break out either above
or below the range we previously identified. Once either your bullish or bearish trade is triggered you want to cancel
the other order. And then you let the breakout continue to your takeprofit or revert to your stoploss if the
breakout fails.

This strategy can make great use of some more advanced topics that we will discuss such as one cancels the other orders and
algorithmic handling of the strategies.

### Straddle Example

In our example we will be looking at trading the US' non-farm payroll. The NFP report is released the first Friday of the
month at 8:30 am EST. This is typically a high impact news event for the US dollar. The NFP report is the total number
of paid workers in the US - farm employees - government employees - private household employees - employees of
nonprofit organizations.

The exact details of the NFP report are not essential. Just recognize that many traders use the NFP as an overall
indicator to the health of the US' economy. If you would like to read more specifically about the NFP report [Investopedia]
(https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/09/non-farm-payroll-report.asp) has some great resources on it.

In this example we will be trading the EUR/USD Forex pair on the morning of May 06, 2022. The NFP report releases at
8:30 am EST so we want to start paying attention to the chart at about 8:00 am EST. We will see that in the half hour
leading up to the release price trades in a small range (indicated by the purple box). We will add an upper boundary
(purple line) and a lower boundary (orange line) for this range.

</figure>

As you can see the upper boundary has a price of 1.05744 so we will set a buy stop order (dashed purple line) slightly
higher at 1.05760. Now a buy order will only be triggered if price actually breaks out of the range. The exact price of the
stop order is not too important. You just want it is close to the range boundary line as possible without having to worry
about noise triggering it.

The lower boundary has a price of 1.05648 so we will set a sell stop order slightly lower at 1.05633 (dashed orange line).
A sell order will only be triggered if price actually breaks out of the range.

  <figcaption>Buy Stop Order Triggered</figcaption>
</figure>

Now 8:30 am EST arrives and we can see that price shot up. Our buy stop order triggered almost immediately. So we cancel
the sell stop order. We then want to add the stoploss order and the takeprofit order to our trade. We will add the stoploss
in the middle of the predefined range. Again the exact price you set it at is not too important just as long as it is
roughly in the middle. The range we identified previously was about 100 pips from bottom boundary to top boundary. So we
set the takeprofit about 100 pips above our entry price.
(If you are not familiar with Forex pips is simply how price is measured. The equivalent in the equities market would be
dollars)

Price quickly shot towards our takeprofit and we secured some sizeable profit in just a couple of minutes. You do not have
to place the stoplosses and takeprofits where we have specified. We chose these levels after conducting some backtesting
but if you find better levels to place them then by all means feel free to adjust this strategy. You ideally want your
risk:reward ration to be at least 1:2. This means that you stand to gain twice as much than you stand to lose. In our example
our stoploss is about 60 pips away from our entry and our takeprofit is about 100 pips away from our entry. This is nearly
a 1:2 risk:reward ratio. Just remember that with this strategy (and most other strategies) your takeprofit should be about
twice as far from your entry as the stoploss is.

In this example we manually closed our sell stop order and manually placed our stoplosses and takeprofit after our buy stop
order was triggered. There are a couple of ways we could improve this method:

- Use one cancels the other order to automatically close the sell stop order after the buy stop order is triggered
- Some brokers allow you to attach stoplosses and takeprofits to a pending stop order
- Creating an algorithm to automate the process
- Use a trailing stoploss to try to achieve maximum profits

## The Fade

The fade is the opposite of the straddle. In the straddle we did not pick an outright direction and attempted to enter
the breakout right as it was starting. In the fade we let the breakout occur and then once the frenzy has died down
we take the opposite direction of the breakout.

If there was a bullish breakout we would then short the asset once the breakout was over. If there was a bearish
breakout breakout we would then buy the asset once the breakout was over.

This strategy works on the philisophy that during major news events the market overreacts. So once all the buying and
selling slows down after the first couple minutes price usually pulls back to a certain degree.

### The Fade Example

In this example we will be using the same 5m EURUSD chart from the straddle example.

  <figcaption>Buy Stop Order Triggered</figcaption>
</figure>

We will enter at the close of the breakout bar (the open of the 8:35 am EST candlestick) as indicated by the purple dashed line.
We are operating off of the assumption that after 5 minutes the major breakout pressure has died down.

We will place the stoploss (red line) at 1.05974 which is slightly above the high of the breakout bar. This gives our trade some
room to breath so our stoploss is not hit by noise. Frequently after the breakout bar the next candlestick will make
another upward push but fail to break the high (or low if a bearish breakout) set by the breakout bar. If price does
break the high set by the breakout bar it invalidates our theory that price will pull back towards the mean and it will
hit our stoploss. This saves us from taking massive losses.

We will place the takeprofit (green line) at 1.05810. Good takeprofit targets are typically a 1:2 risk:reward ratio or halfway
down (or up) the breakout bar. In our case our takeprofit satisfies both of these conditions. The stoploss is about 60 pips
away from our entry and our takeprofit is about 100 pips away from our entry. It is also halfway down the breakout bar.

The exact levels that we place the stoploss, takeprofit, and entry order are not important. There are many valid places
you could place these orders. You should spend some time backtesting and discover what levels are more profitable given
your unique trading methodology. Just ensure that you have close to a 1:2 risk:reward ratio.

## Conclusion

This lesson only covers two potential strategies and only one news event. There are countless news events across all markets
and an infinite number of ways to trade them. The best way to learn is by picking a news event and clicking through
TradingView's historical data to see how the news event affects price action.
