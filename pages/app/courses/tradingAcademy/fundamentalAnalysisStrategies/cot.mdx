# Trading the COT Report

The Commitment of Traders Report is put out by the (Commodity Futures Trading Commission)
[https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/index.htm] every Friday at 2:30 pm EST. It records the net long and
short positions in Futures taken by speculative traders (retail traders and hedge funds) and commercial traders (banks) from
the previous week.

Trading the COT report is a medium-term to long-term strategy. While the report is based upon futures it can be used to
trade other assets such as spot Forex or market index ETFs such as SPY. In this example we will be using the report
to trade SPY.

## Acquiring the COT Report

The COT report can be found on (Commodity Futures Trading Commission's website)
[https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/index.htm]. Scroll down to 'Current Legacy Reports' and click
on 'Short Format' under 'Futures Only' for the 'Chicago Board Options Exchange' row.

This opens the most recent COT report. Past COT reports can be found (here)
[https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/HistoricalViewable/index.htm]. This is useful for backtesting.
This will contain data for all kinds of different futures ranging from butter to the Australian Dollar. We are interested
in the "S&P 500 Consolidated (CFTC ID 13874+). This table is the aggregate of positions in the “CME S&P 500 Stock Index
(CFTC ID 138741)” and the “CME E-Mini S&P 500 Stock Index (CFTC ID 13874A)” contracts.

The "S&P 500 Consolidated" numbers are a great summary of the positions in the S&P500 taken by different market players.

## Understanding the COT Report

There is a lot of information included in the COT report but once you understand what you are looking at it is actually
fairly simple.

- Commercial: Large corporations that use futures to hedge themselves from market fluctuations
- Non-Commercial: Large retail traders, hedge funds, and financial institutions that speculativly trade
- Nonreportable Positions: Number of open contracts that are not required to be reported to CFTC (typically small retail traders)
- Long: Number of long contracts reported to the CFTC
- Short: Number of short contracts reported to the CFTC
- Open Interest: Number of open contracts

## How to trade the COT report

When trading the COT report there are two categories you really want to pay attention to. One is the Commercial long vs short
numbers and the other is the Non-Commercial long vs short numbers.

### Commercial Institutions

Commerical institutions are historically bullish at market bottoms and bearish at market tops. They are not interested in
making a profit but rather prefer to protect their investments from market fluctuations.

### Non-Commercial Institutions

Non-Commercial institutions are purely interested in making a profit and therefore they tend to trend follow. If price is
trending upwards they will continue to buy until the uptrend reverses direction and vice versa for a downtrend. This means
that non-commercial institutions are historically very bullish at market tops and very bearish at market bottoms.

### Charting the COT Report

(barchart.com)[https://www.barchart.com/futures/commitment-of-traders] containes a very useful feature for plotting the
COT data. This allows quick and easy identification of long and short extremes. We will be using the S&P 500 E-Mini (ES)
chart to identify extreme longs and shorts.

The primary chart shows the trading price of S&P 500 E-Mini futures. At the bottom of the chart are two smaller charts.
The top one is labeled COTLC. This is the graph for the Commitments of Traders Report and is what we are interested in.
The other graph labeled COTFTR can be closed.

The red line represents the Commercials. The green line represents the Non-Commercials. The blue line represents the
Small Speculators. We are not too interested in the blue line as this is commonly referred to as the dumb money. It is
small retail traders that frequently do not know what they are doing.

### Entry Conditions

The ideal time to enter a trade is when the Commercials and the Non-Commercials are at an extreme. If the majority of the
Commercials are long and the majority of the Non-Commercials are short this is a good indication that the market is at a
bottom and poised for a reversal. This would be a great time to enter a long trade.

If the majority of the Commercials are short and the majority of the Non-Commercials are long this is a good indication that
the market is at a top and poised for a reversal. This would be a great time to enter a short trade.

### Exit Conditions

There are a couple of potential exit conditions you can use. One is to hold the trade until Commercials and Non-Commercials
return to a state where their net long and short positions are roughly equal. This option will result in more winning trades
but the trades will not be as profitable.

The other option is hold the trade until Commercials and Non-Commercials swap extremes. So if you entered a trade because
the Commercials were net long and the Non-Commercials were net short you would hold the trade until the Commercials were
net short and the non-commercials were net long. This method will have fewer winning trades as sometimes the Commercials
and Non-Commercials will not always swing to the opposite extreme. But the winning trades are typically much larger.

### Example

In our example we will be looking at two potential trades that occurred over the past two years on the S&P 500 E-Mini
chart. Remember that the red line = Commercials and the blue line = Non-Commercials. Also while our chart shows the S&P500
500 E-Mini Future we will actually be trading the SPY ETF. If you compare the 2-year SPY ETF chart on TradingView with
this S&P 500 E-Mini you will see that they closely resemble each other. (Unrelated but this behavior where similar assets
tend to follow each other can lead to cointegration opportunities).

The first example is demonstrated by the vertical orange lines. We can see that from the period 07/07/2020 to 09/03/2020
Commercials were significantly net long while Non-Commercials were net short. This is the perfect time to take a
short trade on SPY. You can see that after 09/03/2020 the markets took a month-long downturn. At 09/24/2020 both the Commercials
and the Non-Commercials returned to the center. This is where we would exit our trade for some nice profit (indicated by
the first green line).

The second example is demonstrated by the vertical purple lines. We can see that from the period 11/01/2021 to 01/04/2021
the Commercials become more and more short while the Non-Commercials became more and more long. This would indicate it
is a good opportunity to take a short trade on SPY. At 01/04/2022 the market began a significant two-month downturn. We would
hold this trade until 03/22/2022 when the Commercials and Non-Commercials returned to the center. This trade would result
in some decent profit.

One of the downsides of using the COT to trade is that the info from the report lags behind the markets by a week. We can see
this with our second trade. Starting on 03/15/2022 the market begins a sharp upturn. Unfortunately this is not reflected in
our COT data until the following week. Almost half of our potential gains were wiped out by this lag. This is why many traders
use other exit methods such as trailing stops and RSI.

## Conclusion

A great longer-term strategy if you do not have the time to watch the charts during the day or have not taken our algorithmic
trading courses yet. Working with this strategy will help develop your understanding of the market and how different players
perceive different market conditions.

Developing a web-scrapping bot with Python is a fantastic way to automate this strategy so that you do not need to read
through a lengthy report every Friday afternoon. Some traders have even created their own indicators based on the COT
report to minimize the effort required on their part.
