# Is it really possible to succeed?

First and foremost it is absolutely possible to succeed. There is an entire population of individual day traders and algorithmic traders with proven track records. So clearly it is possible.

The myth that many people spread that trading is just gambling and you will lose all of your money is simply untrue. The majority of people spreading this message are people who spent a couple of months attempting to trade thinking it was a get rich quick scheme.

And when it didn't immediately make them wealthy they decided it was all a bunch of nonsense. It is easier for them to believe that then to acknowledge that they simply are not willing to put in the time and effort to succeed in this industry.

Trading is a simple game of long-term probabilities. That being said trading is an extremely difficult profession to succeed in. There are a couple of reasons for this:

## No formal education

Most likely you have spent the first 20 or so years of your life in some form of education. Everything you learned in those first 20 years is useless when it comes to trading. Except perhaps a little bit of math.

If you want to learn how to trade you will have to spend your time and energy teaching yourself. That's why this service was created. To provide all the education materials you need in one place.

## Psychology

Many people cannot succeed at trading due to the immense psychological aspects of this profession. You will lose money. You will lose trades. In fact some of the most successful strategies only have a 51% or 52% success rate. Nearly half of their trades are losers. The key is ensuring that you make money over the long term. Many people cannot handle losing trades. They panic and abandon their trading plans and pretty soon they have blown up their account.

As opposed to the majority of professions, you can do everything right with trading and still lose. A lot of people cannot stand this fact. Losing trades are absolutely devastating while winning trades are just moderately satisfying.

## No accountability

With trading you have no boss. You have no timesheets. You have no team members. School, jobs, and families all have structures and people whose entire purpose revolves around holding you accountable to your responsibilities. None of this exists when you are trading. It is completely up to you to stay disciplined day after day.

## Very little consistency

The majority of the population is addicted to guaranteed bi-weekly check. You know “Okay if I show up and sit here for 40-50 hours a week and do enough to not get fired I will receive this amount of income”.

And for many people this is like a morphine drip. They become used to it and are unable to live without it. They crave that low-effort consistency. However with trading, there is absolutely no consistency.

There could be a month where you make $15,000 and then the next month you could lose $7,000. If you are trading correctly you should know that okay in the long-term I will be profitable. But many people cannot handle the uncertainty.

- Yes it is absolutely possible to succeed as a retail trader in the markets.
- But what about everybody who says day trading is just gambling. Nobody actually knows what they are doing right?
- The people who say this either have never tried or gave trading a half-hearted attempt and now spread the message that trading is gambling to make themselves feel better.
- Believe it of not there is an entire section of the population that survives solely off of their trading income.
- This lifestyle appeals to many as it offers freedom from the 9-5 lifestyle and theoretically unlimited earning potential. The better you trade the more money you make which is vastly different from working for somebody else.
- However for every successful trader there is a trader who was not so successful. Losing some or maybe even all of the money they put into the market. Trading is a zero sum game after all.
- If you spend the time and energy to truly understand the markets and how you can extract some profit then it is completely possible to be a successful retail trader.
- How can I compete against hedge funds and market makers?
- In some ways it is easier for a retail trader to extract money from the markets. This topic will be discussed in more detail in future lessons. But for now just understand that retail traders are like nimble squirrels darting in and out of the market to collect small profits. Hedge funds trade such large balances and have to adhere to a multitude of regulations that this actually greatly hinders their possible return.
