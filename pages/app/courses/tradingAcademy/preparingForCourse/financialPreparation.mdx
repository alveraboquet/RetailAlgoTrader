# Financial Preparation

You need to establish a 12-month budget plan. Determine realistic amount of trading capital you could have saved up in 12-months. Be strict about saving money each month to save up to your trading capital goal.

This budget is a great test on whether or not you have the discipline to trade. To be frank if you are unable to adhere to this budget you will struggle with the high-level of discipline require to be a trader.

What this trading capital goal should be is largely dependent on where you live. If you live in the United States $10,000 is a good realistic goal. This will allow you to make decent profits that justify the time and energy.

It will be difficult to make meaningful profits trying to trade with less than $10,000 in the United States. Other countries that threshold will be much lower.

Brokers will allow you to trade with as little as a $100 but this makes it difficult to trade intelligently and severely limits the amount of profit you can make.

If money is tight please do not risk your money trading until you have spent significant time paper trading and have confidence in your strategy.

Trading forex will not make you a millionare over night. It is a very difficult process that takes time. However, if you are able to pull it off the rewards are well worth it.

Being able to handle your finances is absolutely vital to your success as a trader. Cut out all unessential expenses to maximize savings. Trading allows you to use your money to make more money. And the more money you have the more money you can make. And all of this compounds. So get started now on the saving.

The reason for a 12-month budget is on average this course takes 6 months to complete and then you should spend 6 months paper trading. If you are able to consistently make profit over a 6-month period than you will be in good shape for live trading.

NOTE: Absolutely do not start trading with your capital before you have paper-traded for 3 months. 3 months should be the absolute minimum.

Preserving capital is the number 1 goal. There is nothing worse than losing your hard-earned money. Treat your day job as a funding opportunity for your trading. Nobody enjoys working for somebody else but you have to make money before you can even start to make a living off of trading.

## My Biggest mistake

I waited until I started making money to learn about investing and trading. I was making decent money but had no idea how to use this money to make more money. This time period also coincided with the market crash in 2020

If I had started learning about trading earlier I could have gone full-time much sooner. Even if you do not have much money start learning now so once you finally have money you know what you are doing

## How do I trade if I don't have any money?

Nearly all brokers offer a feature called paper trading. These accounts reflect real market conditions and allow you to place trades as if you were actually trading.

Paper trading is one of the most valuable tools in a trader's arsenal. A trader will use paper trading to develop and test their strategies before deploying in the actual markets. In a couple of chapters we will set up a paper trading account for you to start training with.

## How much can I expect to earn?

- Trading capital: $5,000
- Avg yearly return: 20%
- Yearly income: $1,000

- Trading capital: $100,000
- Avg yearly return: 20%
- Yearly income: $20,000

- Trading capital: $1,000,000
- Avg yearly return: 20%
- Yearly income: $200,000

## Three factors in Income Potential

- Trading capital, annual return, annual account growth

1. Trading capital is by far the most impactful of these factors. 10% of $10,000 and 1% of $200,000 both equate to a profit of $2000 but 1% is significantly easier to achieve than 10%. Bottom line is you need money to make money.

2. Annual return is how much your strategy historically returns and how much you anticipate it to return in the future. If you strategy is making less than 10% annually you are probably better off just putting it in an index fund that tracks the market. However, if your strategy can consistently return 20% (a good, realistic return) then your strategy is worth running.

3. Annual account growth is how much of your profit you leave in your account after withdrawing for expenses. Many people do not consider this but one should leave profit in their account. As stated above the more trading capital the more you can make.
