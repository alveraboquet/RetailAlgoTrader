# Backtesting with TradingView

Until you dive into algorithmic trading, TradingView is one of the best resources you have for backtesting. It has historical
data for nearly all assets and all timeframes. It has a very useful Chart Replay function that allows you to set the chart
at a certain date and step through the chart as if you are live trading.

In the top left corner select your asset that you will be trading (EURUSD in this case). Then add the Bollinger Band indicator
that we will be using for this example by clicking the indicator button at the top of the chart. As you can see there are a
bunch of different results that pop up for Bollinger Bands. Many of these are custom indicators created by retail traders such
as yourself. These indicators include small changes and improvements that are aimed at helping you as the trader. For example,
many traders will add automated trade alerts for different indicators. For now just select the indicator called "Bollinger Bands".

Finally, you will want to select the replay button at the top of the chart. A small bar with 4 buttons and a speed slider will pop up.
If you would like to reposition the bar you can use the six dots on the left side to grab and move it. Select the button on the left
called "Jump To..." and scroll to 1/1/2019 and click. You will notice that all the data prior to 1/1/2019 is gone. In this
example we will be using the third button called "Forward". This button will allow us to step through the data one bar at a time
at our own pace.

When backtesting it can become very easy to see a potential setup and then click forward to see if the trade worked out. Do NOT
do this. If you see a trade setup that fits your entry criteria take it and then click forward to see how the trade plays out.
By clicking forward before placing your trade you are inflicting a form of look-ahead bias on yourself.

During live trading future price action is obviously not available. As a result, for backtesting data to be as accurate as
possible future data should not be used to make a trading decision. Backtest conditions need to mirror those of live
trading as closely as possible.

The second button called "Play" is used to automatically step through the data at the speed selected by you on the slider. This
is useful at lower timeframes where you want to simulate live trading. Finally the last button is called "Real-Time" and this
will skip forward to the current bar.

If you are trading Forex another good option is (ForexTester)[https://forextester.com/]. It is a software specifically designed
for backtesting and practice trading. You can provide your own data or use their data subscription. However, it is a little
expensive. Our recommendation for now is to stick with backtesting on TradingView until you decide how you want to continue.

## Strategy to Backtest

We will use the Bollinger Band with Engulfing Bar mean reversion strategy discussed previously. The term engulfing bar used
here is not technically accurate. By the book an engulfing bar completely overshadows the previous bar's body. Really all we are
looking for is a bar trading at a Bollinger Band that is followed by a larger bar with a higher high and close (if bullish)
or a lower low and close (if bearish).

This can take the form of a couple of different chart patterns such as engulfing bars, morning star, hanging man, etc. As you
go through this exercise you will begin to recognize the chart patterns that indicate an ideal setup. This is part of the importance
of thorough backtesting. You come to unconcioulsy recognize setups for your trading system.

### Entry Rules

Remember that we try to eliminate as much subjectivity as possible. We want it to be very evident whether we should or should
not enter a trade. However, if you make your entry rules too strict you will never actually be able to enter any trades. Quality
entry rules eliminate any unnecessary subjectivity while allowing enough discretion from the trader to actually enter trades.

As you move into algorithmic trading, your strategy will need very clear entry rules as they all have to be programmed
for the software to run.

#### Bullish Signal

- Price touches the lower Bollinger Band (It does not need to close outside of the band)
- There should be a smaller bar followed by a bar with a higher close and a higher high
- The close of the larger bar is at least 3/4 of the way up the candlestick

#### Bearish Signal

- Price touches the upper Bollinger Band (It does not need to close outside of the band)
- There should be a smaller bar followed by a larger bar with a lower close and a lower low
- The close of the larger bar is at least 3/4 of the way down the candlestick

### Exit Rules

- The stoploss will be placed at 5 pips from the high of the candlestick that broke the band
  (if a bearish signal) or the low of the candlestick that broke the band (if a bullish signal)
- There will be one take profit that dynamically follows the moving average. Sell 50% of your position at this point.
- There will be a second take profit that dynamically follows the opposite Bollinger Band. Sell the other 50% of you position at
  this point.
- After hitting the first take profit move your stoploss to your entry price

### Risk Managment Rules

- Every trade will risk 2% of your capital.
- Max allowed drawdown will be 20%.
- Only trading EURUSD so correlation is not an issue.

### Trading Journal

For this backtesting session we will use a simple Excel sheet (Click Here for Download)[]. As you become more advanced, you will
want to look at more efficient options such as (TraderSync)[https://tradersync.com/]. Below are the values we will track in our
Excel sheet.

- Date and time trade opened
- Data and time trade closed
- Position Size
- Entry Price
- Exit Price
- Stoploss Price
- Takeprofit Price
- Direction
- Risk / Reward
- Win / Loss
- Profit / Loss
- Market Condition (Upward Trend, Downward Trend, Ranging, etc)
- Picture of trade before opened
- Picture of trade after close
- Additional Thoughts

Feel free to add whatever categories and metrics you would like. The metrics we have included are more than enough to get
started with some simple manual backtesting. For the market condition metric we will jump up to the daily timeframe to determine
the overall market sentiment. While in replay mode, TradingView allows you to change the timeframe without losing your place.
This is an extremely useful tool as you become more advanced.

Keep in mind that you do not need to be perfect with all of the numbers entered into the trading journal. If you are off by
a couple of pips or 50 cents that is fine. We are more concerned with overall long-term performance of the strategy.

### Schedule

- Trading will be conducted from 8:00am EST until 4:00pm EST
- Trades will only be entered on Monday through Thursday
- Trades will be tested during 1/2019 (ranging market) and during 5/2018 (downtrend) on the 4h timeframe

### Backtesting Results for 1/2019

In the image below you can see the overall results of our backtest of this strategy for 1/2019.

  <figcaption>Backtest Metrics for 1/2019</figcaption>
</figure>

There were six trades taken and all were winners. This resulted in a final P/L for the month of $12,163.

The strategy performed equally well on long trades and short trades. Many strategies will only perform well short or long but
this one performs well for both.

The average risk:reward ratio was less than 1 which is not ideal. However, we have such a high win rate that this is not an issue.

This strategy performed great for the month. The reason why is that if you zoom out to the daily chart of 1/2019 you will see
that the market is ranging. Mean reversion strategies such as this one perform great in ranging markets.

Taking a look at our equity curve it is a smooth, upward line. This is an ideal equity curve. You do not want a lot of volatility
in your equity curve. If you have many large peaks and valleys this indicates that your are risking too much per trade.

### Backtesting Results for 5/2018

In the image below you can see the overall results of our backtest of this strategy for 5/2018.

  <figcaption>Backtest Metrics for 5/2018</figcaption>
</figure>

There were 7 trades with 4 winners and 3 losers. This resulted in a final P/L for the month of $4,117.

The strategy had nearly double the average profit per trade on short orders than it did on long orders.

The average risk:reward ratio was about 1 which is not ideal. However, with proper risk management we were able to get by
without this being a huge issue.

This strategy performed much worse than it did in our previous backtest. The reason why is that if you zoom out to the
daily chart of 5/2018 you will see that the market is in a very strong downtrend. Mean reversion strategies such as this
one typically do not perform well during trends.

This also explains why our short trades had such a high profit. Trading with the trend typically results in larger profits
while trading against the trend (our long trades during this backtest) frequently are losers or small winners.

  <figcaption>Equity Curve for 5/2018</figcaption>
</figure>

Taking a look at our equity curve it is a little choppy but there are no massive spikes up or down. We have a proper risk
percetange per trade. Without additional trades it is difficult to tell the quality of this equity curve.

In the links below you can download our completed trade journal to review.

### Possible Improvements

Reviewing the backtesting results, something we noticed was that a lot of the trades taken had an entry price very close to
our first take profit of the BollingerBand moving average. A lot of the trades probably do not have ideal risk:reward ratios.
We should separate all of our trades with poor risk:reward ratios and analyze their metrics separately. We should also see
how removing these trades affect's our strategy's metrics.

You may have noticed with quite a few trades with this strategy that price continued through the moving average to the opposite
Bollinger Band. To take advantage of this we could sell 1/2 of the position at the moving average and the other 1/2 at the
opposite Bollinger Band. You would move the stoploss to your entry price after selling the first 1/2 of the position. This will
ensure you do not exit your trade too early while also protecting your profits from the first 1/2 of your position.

Knowing where to place the stopless can be tricky. We used a set stoploss distance in pips; however, this does not adapt to
market volatility. You could use Average True Range (ATR) to place the stoplosses. This will adapt your stoploss distance to
the current volatility of the markets.

During these backtests we ignored the weekend. However, many traders prefer to have their accounts flat over the weekend.
This just means that they close out of all positions before the close of market hours on Friday afternoon. If we decided
to include this rule in our strategy we would also want to include a rule that does not allow us to enter trades on Friday.
This is because many of our trades take a full day or two to play out. Entering a trade on Friday morning and then having to
close out of it a couple of hours later is not worth the risk.

### Next Steps

This strategy is definitely showing promise. It performed flawlessly in a ranging market and surprisingly well in a trending
market. However, we have only tested 13 trades. This is nowhere near enough to truly understand the long-term profitability
of this strategy.

Before even thinking about live trading this strategy needs to be tested across the following conditions:

- Another ranging market
- 2 different uptrend markets
- Another downtrend market
- 2 black swan events (March Covid dip and BREXIT)

In addition, we traded this strategy on the 4h timeframe which limited the number of trading opportunities. In order to increase
the number of trade opportunities we could trade multiple assets (need to check for correlation) or decrease the timeframe
(need to rerun backtests at new timeframe).

## Why Algorithmic Trading is so popular?

As you most likely noticed going through this process, manually backtesting is very time-intensive. This was a very simple
strategy being tested on one asset with not other strategies being traded at the same time. We still not to conduct multiple
backtests through different market conditions and black swan events.

This is the reason that algorithmic trading is so popular. It allows you to create a strategy and run a multitude of backtests
in a fraction of the time that it would take with manual testing. This is also a reason why so many traders fail. They do not
want to spend the time to learn how to trade algorithmically. At the same time they do not want to spend the time to manually
backtest their strategy. So they jump into the markets with an untested strategy and lose their capital.
