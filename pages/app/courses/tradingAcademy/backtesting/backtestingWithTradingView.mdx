# Backtesting with TradingView

Until you dive into algorithmic trading, TradingView is one of the best resources you have for backtesting. It has historical
data for nearly all assets and all timeframes. It has a very useful Chart Replay function that allows you to set the chart
at a certain date and step through the chart as if you are live trading.

If you are trading Forex another good option is (ForexTester)[https://forextester.com/]. It is a software specifically designed
for backtesting and practice trading. You can provide your own data or use their data subscription. However, it is a little
expensive. Our recommendation for now is to stick with backtesting on TradingView until you decide how you want to continue.

## Strategy to Backtest

We will use the Bollinger Band with Engulfing Bar mean reversion strategy discussed previously.

### Entry Rules

- Price reaches outside of the upper or lower Bollinger Band (It does not need to close outside of the band)
- The following candlestick is an engulfing bar whose body is at least twice as large as the previous candlestick's total height
- The close of the engulfing bar is at least 3/4 of the way up the candlestick if it is a bullish signal and at
  least 3/4 of the way down the candlestick if it is a bearish signal.
- The entry price is not within 1 STD of the moving average.

### Exit Rules

- The stoploss will be placed at 0.25 ATR (Average True Range) from the high of the candlestick that broke the band
  (if a bearish signal) or the low of the candlestick that broke the band (if a bullish signal)
- There will be one take profit that dynamically follows the moving average. Sell 50% of your position at this point.
- There will be a second take profit that dynamically follows the opposite bollinger band. Sell the other 50% of you position at
  this point.
- After hitting the first take profit move your stoploss to your entry price

### Risk Managment Rules

- Every trade will risk 2% of your capital.
- Max allowed drawdown will be 20%.
- Only trading EURUSD so correlation is not an issue.
- Account flat by close of markets on Friday

### Trading Journal

For this backtesting session we will use a simple Excel sheet (Click Here for Download)[]. As you become more advanced, you will
want to look at more efficient options such as (TraderSync)[https://tradersync.com/]. Below are the values we will track in our
Excel sheet.

- Date and time trade opened
- Data and time trade closed
- Position Size
- Entry Price
- Exit Price
- Stoploss Price
- Takeprofit Price
- Direction
- Risk / Reward
- Win / Loss
- Profit / Loss
- Market Condition (Upward Trend, Downward Trend, Ranging, etc)
- Picture of trade before opened
- Picture of trade after close
- Additional Thoughts

Feel free to add whatever categories and metrics you would like. The metrics we have included are more than enough to get
started with some simple manual backtesting.

### Schedule

- Trading will be conducted from 8:00am EST until 4:00pm EST
- Trades will only be entered on Monday through Thursday
- Trades will be tested from 1/2019 to 1/2020 on the daily timeframe
