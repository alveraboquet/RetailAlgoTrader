# Overview of Backtesting

In this lesson you will be introduced to backtesting. Backtesting is one of the most important concepts in trading.

## What is Backtesting

It is the method used to determine if your strategy will be profitable over the long term,
in what market conditions it performs well, and when the strategy has become unprofitable and needs to be shut down. Proper
backtesting involves running your developed strategy through historical data. If manually trading this means that you will
load up data from the past and then step through the data and trade as if it is live data. If trading algorithmically you will
use a platform's backtesting framework to automate the process.

Learning how to properly backtest will be one of the most important lessons in this course. Backtesting is vital to ensuring
that you understand your strategy and have the confidence to trust your strategy. It is the best way to simulate live trading
conditions. It is a safe environment to practice and experiment in without risk of losing money.

Backtesting is a fairly straight-forward procedure that is unfortunately very difficult to perform correctly.
Before you can begin backtesting you must have a full trading strategy developed. This trading strategy must have entry rules,
exit rules, and risk-management rules.

These rules must be very clear and rigid rules. When backtesting you want to eliminate as much subjectivity as possible. There should
not be instances where you are asking yourself "Would I take this trade or not?". It should be very clear based on your
trading system's rules whether or not you would enter the trade.

## Who needs to perform Backtesting?

Every single trader needs to perform backtesting. It does not matter what your strategy is or how skilled of a trader you
are. You need to backtest.

Without backtesting you have no idea if your strategy will be profitable over the longterm. Backtesting gives you an in-depth
understanding of how and why your strategy works. It allows you to understand in what market conditions the strategy works
and in what market conditions the strategy does not work.

During backtesting you will place hundreds of trades. This practice and repetition with your strategy is essential. It will get
to the point where you do not even have to think about your strategy. You can just trade with the confidence that you have
the proof that your strategy is profitable over the long-term.

So many traders just want somebody to hand them the holy-grail of trading strategies. However, even if a great strategy was
given to these traders they would most likely not be profitable. This is because they have not spent the time to truly
understand the strategy. This deep understanding can only come through backtesting.
