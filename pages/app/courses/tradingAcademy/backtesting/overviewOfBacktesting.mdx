# Overview of Backtesting

## What is Backtesting

Backtesting is one of the most important concepts in trading.

It is the method used to determine if your strategy will be profitable over the long term,
in what market conditions it performs well, and when the strategy has become unprofitable and needs to be shut down.

Learning how to properly backtest will be one of the most important lessons in this course. Backtesting is vital to ensuring
that you understand your strategy and have the confidence to trust your strategy.

Backtesting is a fairly straight-forward procedure that is unfortunately very difficult to perform correctly.
Before you can begin backtesting you must have a full trading strategy developed. This trading strategy must have entry rules,
exit rules, and risk-management rules.

These rules must be very clear and rigid rules. When backtesting you want to eliminate as much subjectivity as possible. There should
not be instances where you are asking yourself "Would I take this trade or not?". It should be very evident based on your
trading system's rules whether or not you would enter the trade.

We will use the Bollinger Band with Engulfing Bar mean reversion strategy discussed previously.

Entry Rules:

- Price reaches outside of the upper or lower Bollinger Band (It does not need to close outside of the band)
- The following candlestick is an engulfing bar that is at least twice as large as the previous candlestick that
  broke outside of the band.
- The close of the engulfing bar is at least 3/4 of the way up the candlestick if it is a bullish signal and at
  least 3/4 of the way down the candlestick if it is a bearish signal.
- The entry price is not within 1 STD of the moving average.

Exit Rules:

- The stoploss will be placed at 0.25 ATR (Average True Range) from the high of the candlestick that broke the band (if a bearish signal)
  or the low of the candlestick that broke the band (if a bullish signal)
- There will be one take profit that dynamically follows the moving average. Sell 50% of your position at this point.
- There will be second take profit that dynamically follows the opposite bollinger band. Sell the other 50% of you position at
  this point.
- After hitting the first take profit move your stoploss to your entry price

Risk Managment Rules:

- Every trade will risk 2% of your capital.
- Max allowed drawdown will be 20%.
