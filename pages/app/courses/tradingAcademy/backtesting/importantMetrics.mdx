# Important metrics

When backtesting there are a couple of metrics to take into consideration. These are concepts from statistics that will
ensure you are properly conducting backtesting. We frequently see traders claiming they have a developed a strategy that
can achieve a low-risk, 300% gain in a year or some other similar claim. Then we take a look at their backtest and discover
that they only have 20 tested trades. This is nowhere near enough trades to understand the long-term performance of your
strategy. After extending the number of tested trades out to a couple of hundred we realize that over the long-term the
strategy is not actually profitable.

## Law of Large Numbers

The law of large numbers establishes that as the size of the sample grows the sample average will approach the true population
average. Essentially the greater the number of trades in your backtest the more reflective of true performance the backtest
will be.

This law seems to imply that testing as many trades as possible is your best option. While in general it is true that increasing
the number of trades tested will give you a better representation of actual performance, it is important to remember that
market conditions change. Running a bunch of tests from data in 1995 will not necessarily provide an accurate representation
of how your strategy will perform in today's markets. It is typically always better to test the most recent data you
can. If you are day trading or swing trading there should be more than enough trades to test in the past couple of years.

Another benefit of testing a large number of trades, is that you can see how your strategy performs in a variety of
market conditions. If you only test 20 trades all of these trades may occur during a strong uptrend. You have no idea how
your strategy will perform in a downtrend or ranging market.

Unfortunately we are limited by time and resources, so we need a way to determine if we have tested enough trades in our
backtest to have a reasonable expectation of future performance. This is where the minimum sample size comes into play.

## Minimum Sample Size

Some strategies will not have enough data to achieve this minimum sample size. Strategies such as long-term strategies or
strategies that rely on obscure data may not be able to meet this minimum sample size. That does not mean you should throw the
strategy away. Do the best you can with the data you have but recognize that your strategy is not as strong tested as you
would like.

## P-Hacking

P-Hacking is a statistical concept that is unfortunately a common occurence in science and trading. P-Hacking occurs when you
run many different backtest / optimization iterations but only pay attention to the positive results. By throwing away the
negative results you are making a large mistake.

In backtesting / optimization the negative results are in fact more important than the positive results. For example, you
run a backtest with a set of parameters that returns a poor result. You then modify the parameters slightly and rerun the backtest.
Again you receive a poor result. You continue modifying the parameter until after 6 iterations you receive a positive result. You
use this positive result as an indication you have a profitable strategy with properly optimized parameters.

However in actuality you have ignored all of the negative results. Your strategy is very delicate and it takes very little
change for your strategy to go from profitable to unprofitable. When backtesting and optimizing, small changes in your parameters
should not have a significant impact on your strategy's performance. This indicates that your strategy is resilient and has a
much better chance of being profitable in the long-term.

## Monte Carlo Simulation

Monte Carlo simulations provide insight into how randomness affects the long-term profitability of our strategy. Perhaps the
defining features of the markets is the randomness. Monte Carlo does not provide the solution to this randomness but it does
allow us to see how that randomness will affect our strategy.

When we get into algorithmic trading we will create proper Monte Carlo simulations. For now use the below framework to manually
achieve a similar effect to an automated Monte Carlo Simulation. When making adjustments to these parameters, make small
adjustments. The goal is to analyze how small levels of randomness affect our strategy's performance. For example if you are trading
on the daily timeframe maybe you move your start day up a week or a month. If you are using MACD maybe you increase the period
of the moving averages by 10. In addition, only change one parameter at a time so that it is evident which parameter is causing
large variations in performance.

| Adjusted Parameter            | P/L | Max Drawdown | # Winning Trades | # Losing Trades |
| ----------------------------- | --- | ------------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Move the Start Date Forward   |     |              |                  |                 |
| Move the Start Date Backward  |     |              |                  |                 |
| Increase Trading Parameter #1 |     |              |                  |                 |
| Decrease Trading Parameter #1 |     |              |                  |                 |
| Increase Trading Parameter #2 |     |              |                  |                 |
| Decrease Trading Parameter #2 |     |              |                  |                 |

By slightly adjusting all of these parameters it will become evident how randomness can affect your strategy's performance. For
example, by slightly changing the start date of your backtest your strategy will take an entirely different set of trades than
it took with your original start date.

If you have developed a resilient strategy it will be profitable across all or most of these variations. The small changes in
parameters should not have a large impact on performance. If you find that the randomness introduced by Monte Carlo simulations
does have a large impact on your strategy's performance then do not launch your trading strategy on the live markets. You need
to continue working on the strategy to ensure that is resilient through different market conditions and that it is not overfit
to historical data.
