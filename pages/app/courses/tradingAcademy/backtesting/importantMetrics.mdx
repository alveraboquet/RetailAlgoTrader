# Important metrics

When backtesting there are a couple of metrics to take into consideration. These are concepts from statistics that will
ensure you are properly conducting backtesting. We frequently see traders claiming they have a developed a strategy that
can achieve a low-risk, 300% gain in a year or some other similar claim. Then we take a look at their backtest and discover
that they only have 20 tested trades. This is nowhere near enough trades to understand the long-term performance of your
strategy. After extending the number of tested trades out to a couple of hundred we realize that over the long-term the
strategy is not actually profitable.

## Law of Large Numbers

The law of large numbers establishes that as the size of the sample grows the sample average will approach the true population
average. Essentially the greater the number of trades in your backtest the more reflective of true performance the backtest
will be.

This law seems to imply that testing as many trades as possible is your best option. While in general it is true that increasing
the number of trades tested will give you a better representation of actual performance, it is important to remember that
market conditions change. Running a bunch of tests from data in 1995 will not necessarily provide an accurate representation
of how your strategy will perform in today's markets. It is typically always better to test the most recent data you
can. If you are day trading or swing trading there should be more than enough trades to test in the past couple of years.

Another benefit of testing a large number of trades, is that you can see how your strategy performs in a variety of
market conditions. If you only test 20 trades all of these trades may occur during a strong uptrend. You have no idea how
your strategy will perform in a downtrend or ranging market.

Unfortunately limited by time and resources, so we need a way to determine if we have tested enough trades in our
backtest to have a reasonable expectation of future performance. This is where the minimum sample size comes into play.

## Minimum Sample Size

Some strategies will not have enough data to achieve this minimum sample size. Strategies such as long-term strategies or
strategies that rely on obscure data may not be able to meet this minimum sample size. That does not mean you should throw the
strategy away. Do the best you can with the data you have but recognize that your strategy is not as strong tested as you
would like.
