# Walk-Forward Optimization

Walk-forward optimization is a statistical method for finding the optimal parameters for a strategy through backtesting on
multiple sets of in-sample data and out-of-sample data that overlap. Walk-forward optimizations in one of the best methods
for optimizing your strategy without overfitting. Walk-forward optimization is seen in a lot of fields outside of trading
as well. Really any process that uses machine-learning will incorporate walk-forward optimizations.

## What Parameters should we Optimize?

There are many parameters that can be optimized depending on your strategy. Time periods for indicators, STD for Bollinger Bands,
cointegration thresholds, and much more are all strategy parameters that can be optimized. When optimizing a strategy you should
settle on a small amount of parameters (2 or 3) to optimize.

As the number of parameters being optimized increases, the risks of overfitting increases. If you are optimizing every parameter
in your strategy then the strategy will perform great on your test data but be useless on any other dataset.

Do NOT include risk percentage as a parameter to be optimized. There are methods to properly optimize risk percentage; however,
they are advanced techniques that will be discussed in the future. For now just choose a set risk percentage and do not adjust it.

## Optimization Criteria

In order to properly optimize you need to have a single goal to actually optimize to. This is known as the optimization criteria.
This is not to be confused with the parameters of your trading strategy. The optimization criteria is a single metric that ranks
the performance of every parameter optimization run. It attempts to find the "best" combination of parameter values. Examples of
optimized parameters are:

- Balance
- Profit Factor
- Expected Payoff
- Maximal Drawdown
- Drawdown Percent

For example, if balance is chosen as your optimization objective then parameter combinations that result in the highest account
balance would score higher. Parameter combinations that result in a lower account balance would score lower. Many novice traders
only care about their long-term account balance and as a result only optimize their strategy to account balance. However, a strategy
purely optimized to account balance can frequently result in lots of volatility and large drawdowns.

### Risk-Adjusted Optimization Criteria

In order to achieve balanced optimized parameters you should separately optimize to multiple criteria and then compare the results.
Spend time optimizing to account
balance. Then spend time optimizing to max drawdown. Then spend time optimizing to profit factor. Finally compare the
parameters returned by these three seperate optimization runs. You will see how much of an impact the optimization criteria
has on the returned parameters.

Most likely the ideal optimized parameters will be a combination of the three separate runs. This will provide a more balanced
strategy that is not overly optimized to any one objective. Earlier we discussed how optimizing to account balance can result
in large volatility in your account balance. Well optimizing to max drawdown has the opposite effect. It will return parameters
that result in minimal drawdown but probably also result in minimal account growth. By combining the two you can achieve
optimized parameters that result in good account growth while keeping drawdowns small.

Thankfully we do not have to run separate optimization runs and then try and combine the parameters manually. There are risk-adjusted
optimization criteria that can be used to return balanced parameters. Examples of risk-adjusted optimization criteria are:

- Account Balance / Max Drawdown
- Sharpe Ratio

## Walk-Forward methodology

In the diagram below we take a look at how walk-forward optimization works. In this example we have data for year 2020 and 2021.
This data has been broken up into 3 sets of training and testing data. Each block of training data is a year long and each
block of testing data is four months long. Our trading strategy will use the daily timeframe which is why it is being optimized
across two years of data. If your strategy trades on a shorter timeframe such as 30m you can run the optimization on a shorter
set of data. At 30m you might only need 2 or 3 months worth of data.

The process is detailed below:

1. Backtest and optimize parameters on training set #1
2. Review performance on testing set #1
3. Backtest and optimize parameters on training set #2
4. Review performance on testing set #2
5. Backtest and optimize parameters on training set #3
6. Review performance on testing set #3
7. Compare the performance across all three trainging sets
8. Take the best performing training set's parameters and test these parameters on the other two training sets

## Conclusion

After backtesting and optimizing your strategy, be sure that you spend ample time analyzing the backtests and optimizations.
Be sure you understand when your strategy works and when it does not work. If your strategy is intended to be a mean-reversion
strategy but it performs very well during trending markets look into this. It is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, you may
have developed a very profitable strategy. But you need to ensure that you understand why your strategy performs the way it does.
