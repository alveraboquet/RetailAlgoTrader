# Importance of Backtesting

Backtesting is important for a variety of reasons:

- Evaluate your strategy across different market conditions
- Understand how your strategy handles Black Swan events
- Provide a foundation for your trading psychology

## Evaluate Your Strategy Across Different Market Conditions

The majority of strategies out there focus on specific market conditions. At the most basic level the market conditons would be
uptrend, downtrend, or ranging. There are very few strategies that perform well across all market conditions. As you become
more advanced you will discover strategies such as cointegration that can work well in a variety of market conditions. However,
starting out your strategies will be fairly basic and most likely not work in all market conditions.

For example most strategies can be divided into trend-following or mean-reversion strategies. Trend-following strategies
tend to work well in trending markets and mean-reversion strategies tend to work well in ranging markets. A trend-following
strategy will get slaughtered in a market that ranges for a long period of time.

The table below details the different market conditions that your strategy should be tested across.

| Market Condition | # of Trades | P/L (%) | Max Drawdown |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------- | ------------ |
| Downtrend #1     |             |         |              |
| Downtrend #2     |             |         |              |
| Downtrend #3     |             |         |              |
| Uptrend #1       |             |         |              |
| Uptrend #2       |             |         |              |
| Uptrend #3       |             |         |              |
| Ranging #1       |             |         |              |
| Ranging #2       |             |         |              |
| Ranging #3       |             |         |              |
| Black Swan #1    |             |         |              |
| Black Swan #2    |             |         |              |
| Black Swan #3    |             |         |              |

As you learn more about trading, you will gain the skills to develop more technical and advanced strategies than just
trend-following or mean-reversion strategies. This advanced strategies will focus on more nuanced market conditions than
just uptrend, downtrend, and ranging.

### Black Swan Events

In addition to standard market conditions you need to test your strategy across different Black Swan events. Black Swan
events are freak market conditions that occur unexpectedly and are difficult to prepare for. Some examples of Black Swan events
are the dot-com bubble, the unpegging of the Swiss Franc, and the March 2020 Covid dip. See below for a more length list of
Black Swan events.

| Black Swan Event               | Date |
| ------------------------------ | ---- |
| Asian Financial Crisis         | 1997 |
| Dot-Com Crash                  | 2000 |
| Crash of 9/11                  | 2001 |
| Global Financial Meltdown      | 2008 |
| European Sovereign Debt Crisis | 2009 |
| Fukushima Nuclear Disaster     | 2001 |
| Crude Oil Crisis               | 2014 |
| Black Monday China             | 2015 |
| BREXIT                         | 2016 |
| Covid                          | 2020 |
| Swiss Franc Unpegging          | 2015 |
| WTI Futures Going Negative     | 2020 |

These events happen extremely quickly and cause massive jumps in price. Preparing for these events is very difficult as there
are so few to test your strategy on. In addition, during these events market conditions you take for granted such as high liquidity
and minimal slippage may be invalidated.

For example on January 15th, 2015 the Swiss announced that the Franc would no
longer be pegged to the Euro. Immediately the Swiss Franc skyrocketed. Traders that were short the Swiss Franc in any currency
pair such as the CHFEUR or CHFUSD experienced huge losses. The price shot up so quickly that even if short traders had set a
stoploss at 0.8500 it was not getting fulfilled until .9500. That is a full 100 pips later which resulted in massive losses
especially with the level of leverage available in the Forex market.

The above image illustrates the massive price jump that occured in CHFEUR almost instantly. While this is the most extreme example of a Black Swan event, it does demonstrate the risks posed by Black Swan events. During
backtesting you should pick 2 or 3 Black Swan events and see how your strategy handles them.

Each of these events typically targets a specific market. You may not even be trading that specific market; however, this events
typically have large ripple effects in all markets.

### Trading Psychology

Trading is a difficult and stressful endeavor. When you are stressed you tend to make poor decisions. These poor decisions
cause you to lose money. This stresses you out even more and you make even more poor decisions. This cycle continues until
you quit or you run out of capital.

Backtesting helps to eliminate much of this stress and poor decision making. When trading you will experience a drawdown. It
is inevitable. If you have not backtested your strategy you will begin to doubt your strategy. You will start to modify your
strategy to try and make back your capital. However if you are constantly modifying your strategy is impossible to tell how
it is performing. You cannot tell which aspects of the strategy are performing well and which are not because you are constantly
changing everything.

A lengthy backtest process provides the confidence that your strategy will work over the long-term. When your strategy hits
a drawdown you can look at your testing and know that your strategy always recovered from these drawdowns. This confidence
allows you to continue trading your system through drawdowns. If you have properly tested your strategy and are experiencing
a drawdown it is essential that you stick with your strategy.

### Strategy Portfolios

As you develop your own strategies and discover which market conditions they
perform well in, these strategies can be combined. If you are trading multiple strategies that all handle different market
conditions then you can profitably trade in all market conditions.

| Strategy                                  | P/L during Ranging Market |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| MA Crossover (Trend-Following)            | -$4,000                   |
| Bollinger Band Reversion (Mean-Reversion) | $10,000                   |
| News Trading (Breakout)                   | -$2,000                   |

| Strategy                                  | P/L during Trending Market |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| MA Crossover (Trend-Following)            | $5,000                     |
| Bollinger Band Reversion (Mean-Reversion) | -$3,000                    |
| News Trading (Breakout)                   | $1,000                     |

Many traders create algorithms to weight their different strategies. So if the market is ranging they might invest 75% of their
capital with their mean-reversion strategy and 25% of their capital with their trend-following strategy. Once the market begins
to trend upward then they allocate 75% of their capital to their trend-following strategy and 25% to their mean-reversion
strategy.

Developing and managing a portfolio of strategies is a more advanced topic. We included a brief discussion of it here so that
you see the importance of backtesting. Without backtesting you will not gain the proper understanding of when your strategy
works well and when it does not.
