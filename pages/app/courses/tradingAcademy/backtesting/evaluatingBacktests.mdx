# Evaluating Backtests

It is not enough to just run a backtest and see that it produces a profitable result. There is a multitude of analysis that
must be conducted on the results to determine the validity of the backtest. Throughout the lessons of this chapter we have
looked at varying methods to accomplish the below goals.

## Verify Trades

This is more of a focus with algorithmic trading to ensure there are no coding errors; however, it is still useful with manual trading.
Choose ten long trades and ten short trades. Now verify that your entry rules, exit rules, and risk management rules were
followed for each and every trade. If you are manually backtesting and the trades do not adhere to your system's rules this
indicates that you are not consistently following your trading system.

## Ensure Strategy is Resilient

This can be accomplished through Monte Carlo analysis. By making small, random changes to the strategy and testing conditions
we can understand how the strategy handles the randomness it will encounter in live trading.

## Analyze when Strategy Works

Earlier we looked at the below table.

| Uptrend #1       |             |         |              |
| Uptrend #2       |             |         |              |
| Uptrend #3       |             |         |              |
| Ranging #1       |             |         |              |
| Ranging #2       |             |         |              |
| Ranging #3       |             |         |              |
| Black Swan #1    |             |         |              |
| Black Swan #2    |             |         |              |
| Black Swan #3    |             |         |              |

Be sure that you have a proper understanding of the market conditions that are favorable to your strategy.

## Conclusion

When backtesting and optimizing a strategy you should constantly be analyzing the results. Figure our how your strategy is
working, why it is working, and when it is working. An in-depth understanding of a proven strategy is the true key to
profitable trading.
