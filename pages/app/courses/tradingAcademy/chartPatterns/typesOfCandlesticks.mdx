# Types of Candlesticks

## Candlestick Basics

As previously discussed every candlestick has a high, low, open, and close. If the close price is below the open price the candlestick will be red. If the close price is above the open price the candlestick will be green.

Every candlestick has a body and two wicks. The body is the area between the open and the close. The wicks are the area between the high and open/close and the low and open/close.

Below we will discuss a couple of the more common shapes that candlesticks can take. By themselves these candlestick shapes are not very useful; however, when combined to create chart patterns they can become very powerful.

## Doji

A doji has an equally sized wick on the top and the bottom with a very thin body. Dojis can be either green or red. Dojis are considered indecision candles. Buyers and sellers are waiting to see what will happen. Dojis frequently indicated a price reversal.

## Gravestone

A gravestone has an almost entirely absent body at the very bottom of the candlestick with a large wick above the body. They indicate that buyers attempted to push the price higher but failed.

## Dragonfly

A dragonfly is the opposite of a gravestone. It has a small body at the very top of the candlestick with a large wick below the body. They indicate that sellers attempted to push the price lower but failed.
