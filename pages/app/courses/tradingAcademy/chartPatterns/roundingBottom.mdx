# Rounding Bottom

A rounding bottom is a bullish signal that forms when a downtrend reverses direction and begins to trend upward. Rounding bottoms take a long time to form so require a lot of patience from the trader.

Rounding bottoms is a less popular chart pattern to trade as by the time it forms it is typically already very evident that price has reversed direction.
