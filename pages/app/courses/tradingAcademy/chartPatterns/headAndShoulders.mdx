# Head and Shoulders

A head and shoulders chart pattern forms after a strong uptrend. It is a strong bearish signal. Price will peak at the end of the uptrend. This forms the first shoulder.

Price will then push slightly higher but ultimately end up peaking and reversing downward. This forms the head. Price will then make a weak attempt to push higher but will not exceed the peak of the head. This forms the second shoulder.

The uptrend has lost momentum. Price has attempted to push higher three times but was unable to push higher. It is encountering strong resistance.

After a head and shoulders price frequently makes a strong downward movement.

## Inverted Head and Shoulders

This is the same as a head and shoulders just opposite. An inverted head and shoulders will frequently result in the start of an upward movement.
