# Choose a Strategy

At this point you have enough knowledge to develop your first trading system. Throughout this chapter and the backtesting
chapter we will go through the process of developing and testing the Bollinger Band reversion strategy that was discussed
previously in the course.

Our recommendation is to observe how we develop the Bollinger Band reversion strategy with EURUSD and follow the same steps to
develop your own strategy. By actively following along you will gain much more from the following chapters. For this first
strategy make it fairly simple. Focus on one or two indicators combined with a chart pattern. Right now the focus is more on
learning the process than developing an actual profitable strategy.

## Why is a Trading Plan so Important?

A proper trading plan is essential to long-term profitability. Many people begin trading thinking it will be easy money and
are shocked when they lose all of their capital. Then they close their accounts and continue to feed into the narrative
that trading is just gambling. You would never just show up to an NFL practice and expect to make the team.

Being a successful trader requires practice, discipline, and a plan. A proper trading plan is what separates 'dumb money' from
profitable traders. A trading plan requires a couple of key benefits:

1. Trading Rules

- The entry, exit, and risk management rules are all clearly laid out
- This makes it very clear whether or not a trade should be entered. You do not have to sit there and debate whether or
  not you should enter the trade. This greatly decreases the stress and energy involved in trading.
- These trading rules can be tested on historical data
- This gives you a reasonable expectation of how your strategy should perform and in what market conditions it does and
  does not perform well

2. Accountability

- Having a well-structured trading plan holds you accountable
- With trading you are your own boss. This requires an immense amount of discipline.
- Having a framework that dictates when and how you conduct your trading is invaluable

3. Pyschological Health

- Every strategy will experience a streak of losers also known as a drawdown
- This is always very tough on your trading psychology
- You begin to question your strategy and your abilities so you begin to modify your strategy or even abandon your strategy
- This is the wrong thing to do. You need to stick with your trading plan even through drawdowns.
- A well-constructed trading plan can be backtested. You have the histoical data proving that your strategy is profitable.
- You understand how your strategy performs over the long-term. You can historically check the max drawdown of your strategy
  and see that it managed to bounce back
- A good trading plan gives you the peace of mind and confidence that your strategy will work over the long-term

A trading plan is not a trading algorithm. These are separate things. A trading plan can incorporate algorithms to help enforce
and act out the trading plan; however, a trading plan is simply a set of rules that you as a trader need to follow.

A trading plan is so effective because it is repeatable. It provides consistent conditions for trading that can later be
analyzed. Without a trading plan it is almost impossible to accurately gauge your strategy's performance.

## Components of a Trading Plan

1. Risk Management Strategy
2. Entry Rules
3. Exit Rules
4. Trading Journal
5. Schedule

These five components listed above are absolutely required to develop a successful trading plan. We will discuss each of
these in-depth.
