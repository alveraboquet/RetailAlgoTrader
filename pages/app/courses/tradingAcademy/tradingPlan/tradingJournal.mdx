# Trading Journal

Unlike the first three components of a trading strategy, a trading journal has nothing to do with trade management. A trading
journal is used to log trades. This allows analysis of your performance and long-term trends of your strategy. It also allows
you to recognize if you are properly following your trading system.

## Components of a Trading Journal

All trading journals should include at a minimum the following:

- Date and time the trade is opened
- Date and time the trade is closed
- Asset
- Position Size
- Entry Price
- Exit Price
- Stoploss Price
- Takeprofit Price
- Risk / Reward
- Profit / Loss
- Market Condition (Upward Trend, Downward Trend, Ranging, etc)
- Picture of trade before opened
- Picture of trade after close
- Additional Thoughts

## How to Create a Trading Journal

In the beginning most people simply use an excel spreadsheet to track their trades. However, as you become more advanced and
trade more often you need to upgrade to a more advanced tool. Our recommendation is (tradersync)[https://tradersync.com/]. It
allows complex analysis as well as integration with your brokers so that you do not have to type in all of your trades'
information manually.
