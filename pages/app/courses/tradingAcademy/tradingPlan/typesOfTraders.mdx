# Types of Traders

The first step to developing your own trading plan is determining what type of trader you are. Traders can be broken up
into three groups:

1. Day Traders
2. Swing Traders
3. Long-Term Traders
4. Investors

## Day Traders

Day traders enter a trade and exit that same trade all within one trading day. Trades can be held anywhere from a couple of
seconds to a period of hours. However as a day trader you close out all of your positions prior to market close. Day traders
typically do not want to be exposed to overnight risk and volatility.

Day trading can be focused on making a large number of short-term, small trades (known as scalping) or focused on making one
well-researched gap trade. These are just two examples of how people daytrade. Day trading is almost all technical analysis
as fundamental analysis is essentially impossible to conduct at such a low timeframe. Traders use indicators, price action,
volume, and mathematical formulas to trade.

Daytrading requires a very specific personality in order to be successful. Day trading is very intense and chaotic. It requires
lots of time in front of the screen and requires a lot of focus.

The shorter the timeframe being traded the more stressful it is to make trading decisions. You have less time to analyze
potential trades and trades can go wrong much quicker. You cannot afford to step away from the screen especially if you
have any open trades.

Draining is an accurate way to define day trading. Until you become a skilled trader day trading will feel very exhausting.
Many people cannot handle the psychological aspect of day trading. You are having to quickly make decisions that could win or
lose you thousands of dollars. Many people underestimate how stressful this process can be. That is why it is important to
progress slowly and backtest your trading systems so that you have faith in your abilities.

Despite all of these negatives, day trading is still the most popular way to trade. The reasoning for that is that the most
money can be made day trading. Now that does not mean you will make the most money day trading. Many people are simply not
cut out for the fast-pace of day trading and can actually make much more money if they were to make less trades on a longer
timeframe.

All else being equal trading a shorter timeframe will provide more trading opportunities and thus more potential profit. But
again this is highly dependent upon your trading psychology and skill level.

Algorithmic trading appeals to many day traders because it helps to decrease the stress and energy. Entry and exit rules are
programmed so there is no stressful decision-making on whether or not you should enter a trade. You do not have to spend all
day staring at the screen stressing out about trades. The algorithm handles all of the day-to-day activities and you review
the performance when you have time.

When starting out we recommend that you focus on swing trading before moving on to day trading. And once you begin day trading
work your way from longer to shorter timeframes. Spend a couple of months trading the 4h timeframe then the 1h timeframe then
the 30m timeframe and so on.

Like everything else trading is a skill that requires strong foundational skills before moving onto advanced techniques.

### Average Day for a Day Trader

Day traders will wake up a couple of hours before market open. This allows them to analyze the markets and potential trades
during pre-market hours. Pre-market hours are a great time to find opportunities and gauge overall market sentiment. They will
also check their economic calendars and market news to ensure they do not get blindsided by an earnings report or announcement.
Once the markets open traders will stay glued to their screen until about lunchtime.

During lunch the markets tend to quiet down and there are not many trading opportunities. Many advanced traders will stop trading
after lunch as the morning hours have the best opportunities. Less advanced traders that struggle to recognize or take
advantage of trade opportunities may continue to trade during the afternoon hours. The exception to this is closing hour. Many
traders that previously stopped trading will sign back on for the last hour of the trading day. The last hour tends to have
increased volatility and good trading opportunities as people close out of positions and setup positions for overnight holds.

After a trader pulls out of the markets his day is not done. He will then analyze every trade he made. He will take a look at
the entry rules, exit rules, and trades taken to ensure that he is following his trading system properly. All of these trades
and any observations he makes will be added to a trading journal.

After analyzing the day's trades, he will then analyze the longterm performance of his trading strategy. This performance will
be compared with the backtests to ensure that the strategy is performing as expected.

All of this post-trading analysis is why advanced traders typically focus on the first half of the day for trading. This allows
them to spend a couple of hours in the afternoon reviewing their trades and strategy and still signoff at a decent time. When
traders spend the whole market-day trading they then have to spend a couple more additional hours evaluating trades. This can
make for a very long day.

## Swing Traders

Swing traders focus on slighly longer-term trades. This can be a couple of days up to a week or two. They are fine holding
trades overnight and over the weekend.

Swing traders take much fewer trades than day traders. They tend to focus on the 4h timeframe up to the weekly timeframe.
Swing trading is still mostly focused on technical analysis as fundamental analysis is still difficult to effeciently conduct
at these timeframes. However, it is very important for swing traders to monitor their calendars and the news.

Swing trading is a much better fit for the beginner trader or the part-time trader. In order to properly day trade it basically
becomes a full-time job. Swing trading can be done before work, during breaks, or after work depending on what markets are
being traded. Many people use swing trading as a way to supplement their income from a day job.

Since the timeframe being traded is longer it is much less stressful to swing trade. You have much more time to analyze trades
before taking them. Trades take a couple of days to play out which gives you time to exit a trade if it is going poorly before
too much money is lost.

From a psychological perspective swing trading is much easier than day trading. This is why it is recommended for beginner
traders. It is a lower-stress environment that allows you to build up the necessary trading skills.

Unfortunately due to the longer timeframes swing trading has less trading opportunities. All else being equal this means
there is less potential profit to be made.

Algorithmic trading is also very useful for swing trading. It can monitor the markets for opportunities and send trade alers.
It handles entry and exit rules so you do not have to constantly check-in on your trade.

When starting out we recommend that you focus on swing trading before moving on to day trading. Swing trading provides a much
better environment for learning and will allow you to understand how trading affects your psychology. Jumping straight into
day trading is a recipe for disaster.

### Average Day for a Swing Trader

It is difficult to come up with a typical day for a swing trader because swing traders have much more flexibility than day
traders. Many swing traders work full-time and trade before or after work. Some swing traders use trading as their primary
source of income and may spend a couple of hours analyzing market opportunities when they get a chance.

Regardless of when you trade as a swing trader there are a couple of constants. Prior to market open swing traders check
the calendar and news to ensure that nothing major has happened that would affect any of their open trades. A couple of times
per day they will check their trades just to ensure everything is performing as expected. After market close they will
inventory which trades were closed out and which trades are still open.

At this point a swing trader may spend an hour or so in the evening analyzing trades and updating their trading journal. Or many
swing traders will spend a couple of hours on the weekend analyzing the entire week's worth of trades at once. It is really
up to the trader.

Swing trading is a much more flexible and less stressful approach to trading than day trading. Quality swing traders can
make just as much and more than average day traders. It is also a great method for learning trading fundamentals and
testing trading strategies.

## Long-Term Traders

Long-term traders are very similar to swing traders except trades are held for a couple of months to a couple of years.

Long-term traders take very few trades. However, these trades are well-researched and backed by strong fundamental data in
addition to strong technicals. They tend to focus on the weekly timeframe and up.

With day trading and swing trading it is possible to get by with minimal understanding of an asset's fundamentals. However,
with long-term trading it is essential that you stay informed of the asset's fundamentals. For example, if making a long-term
trade of TSLA it is important to now only keep up with TSLA's financial reports but also the US market in general and even
Elon Musk's other business deals.

The longer the timeframe the more impact fundamental data has on the trade. Long-term trading tends to be a better technique
for professional traders and hedge funds. Collecting and analyzing all the relevant data is very resource intensive and
requires the proper skillsets.

In addition, there are very few trades taken in a long-term trading system so the potential profit is not at large. It requires
a lot of capital to make meaningful profit from long-term trades. This is another reason why this technique favors more
advanced traders.

However as a small retail trader it is certainly possible to be a successful long-term trader. It is just a much different
approach to trading than day trading or swing trading.

Algorithmic trading can still play a very important role in algorithmic trading. Algorithms are created to collect data,
organize data, analyze the data, and provide the best potential trades. Managing data is a very resource-intensive process
so creating systems to automate it can be of huge benefit.

## Investors

Most of us are already investors. These are accounts such as IRAs, 401ks, or even real estate. With investing you have a very
long-term goal of safe, steady capital growth. Trades are held for 20, 30, or even 40 years and just allowed to grow. This
technique is primarily used for retirement or college savings.

Investing for retirement is a much different technique than trading for profit and as a result it is not a focus of this
course.
