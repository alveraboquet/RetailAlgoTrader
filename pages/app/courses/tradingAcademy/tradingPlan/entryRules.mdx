# Entry Rules

Every trading strategy should have a strict set of entry rules. If these entry rules are met and the parameters of the risk
management strategy are met then a trade should be entered. Entry rules should require multiple separate conditions to qualify
as a valid trade entry. For example a MA crossover that coincides with RSI showing oversold. These are two separate indicators
and if they both provide a trading signal at the same time this provides more reinforcement that it is a quality trade.

You can add even more entry rules if you want such as chart patterns or news catalysts. However, if you add too many trade
conditions your strategy will become too restrictive. There will be very few trade opportunities that meet all of your
entry rules.

Entry rules should remove as much subjectivity as possible. Here is an example of a poor entry rule:

- Enter on an indecisive bar followed by an engulfing bar

Here is how that entry rule can be improved:

- Wait for a bar whose body is less than 20% of the candlestick with roughly equal top and bottom wicks
- The following bar should have a body at least x3 the size of the indecision candle's total height (high - low)
- The engulfing bar should exceed the high (bullish signal) or low (bearish signal) of the indecision candle
- If it is a bullish engulfing bar it should occur during a downtrend (indicates a bullish reversal)
- If it is a bearish engulfing bar it should occur during an uptrend (indicates a bearish reversal)

The second example is much more specific than the first example. It removes as much subjectivity as possible in an attempt
to clearly define what is and is not a valid trade signal. This rule should then be combined with another rule or two.

In the beginning aim for two or three entry rules. Strict entry rules that determine your trade entries helps your trading
psychology. It removes the stress on deciding whether or not you should enter a trade. The trade either meets your entry rules
or it does not. Set entry rules also allow efficient and accurate backtesting. If you strategy is very subjective it is easy
to have inaccurate backtests. This will be discussed in-depth in the next chapter.

## Bollinger-Band Reversion Entry Rules

Following are the entry rules we will use for our Bollinger Band reversion strategy

### Breaks upper or lower Bollinger Band

- For a bullish signal a candlestick's low must exceed the lower Bollinger Band
- For a bearish signal a candlestick's high must exceed the upper Bollinger Band
- The candlestick's close is allowed to be within the Bollinger Bands

### Following Bar is Engulfing Bar

- The next bar should have a body (open - close) at least x2 that of the previous candlestick's total height (high - low)
- For a bullish signal the close of the engulfing bar should be within 10 pips of its' low
- For a bearish signal the close of the engulfing bar should be within 10 pips of its' high

### Trade Entry provides at least a 1:1.5 risk:reward ratio

- No trade will be entered if the risk:reward ratio is less than 1.5

### Account Should be Flat on Friday

Many traders do not like to hold trades over the weekend. As trades can gap up or down significantly at market open after a
weekend. This can result in large unexpected losses especially in a margin account.

'Going flat' or a 'flat account' means there are no open positions. On Friday's we will not initiate any new positions and we
will close all positions prior to market close.
