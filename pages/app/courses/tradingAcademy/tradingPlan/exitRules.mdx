# Exit Rules

Every trading strategy should have a strict set of exit rules. If these exit rules are met the trade will be exited. There should
be no adjusting the exit rules because you feel as though the market is going to turn in your favor. Set the exit rules and
adhere to them. Exit rules are typically more straight-forward than entry rules.

A proper exit strategy will typically consist of a stoploss and a takeprofit that is set when the trade is made. For example
a stoploss set $5 below the entry candlestick's low and a takeprofit set at the moving average.

Exit rules should remove as much subjectivity as possible. Here is an example of a poor exit rule:

- Exit if price action reverses away from takeprofit

This is a poor exit rule because it involves way too much subjectivity. How do you know if price action has actually reversed?
At what point has it reversed too much? Maybe it is going to change directions again and go back towards your takeprofit? Having
to make all of these decisions for every trade is exhausting and stressful.

Here is how that exit rule can be improved (these will also be the exit conditions for our Bollinger-Band Reversion Strategy):

- Stoploss will be placed 10 pips below (if bullish signal) or above (if bearish signal) the indecision candle's low / high
- A takeprofit will be placed at the Bollinger Band's center moving average (1/2 of the position will be sold here)
- A second takeprofit will be placed the Bollinger Band's opposite band (Upper if bullish and lower if bearish) (Sell remaining position)
- The takeprofits will be adjusted to dynamically track the Bollinger Band's moving average
- If first takeprofit is hit the stoploss will be moved to the trade's entry price
- All trades will be closed prior to market close on Friday

The second example is much more specific than the first example. It removes as much subjectivity as possible in an attempt
to clearly define when and how a trade should be exited.

Exit rules can become more advanced as you progress. They can use trailing stops and indicators as exit conditions.
