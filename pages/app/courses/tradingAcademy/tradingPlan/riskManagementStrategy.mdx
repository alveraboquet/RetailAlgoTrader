# Risk Management Strategy

The most important part of your trading plan is your risk management strategy. Even if you screw up every other aspect of the
trading plan your risk management strategy will ensure that you do not lose too much capital. Remember that our primary goal is
to preserve capital. It is not to make massive profits. If we preserve our capital profits will come.

## Components of a Risk Management Strategy

The following are the primary considerations for a risk management strategy.

### Percent Risked

Your strategy should choose a set risk percentage. Every trade will risk the same amount. This will typically be 1% or 2%
of your account value. This ensures that no one trade can lose too much of your capital. Even 'sure' trades will frequently
turn out to be losing trades.

As you become a more advanced trader you can increase your percent risked. You can also develop conditions that dictate percent
risked. For example if your trading system provides a strong technical trading signal and there was recently a strong news
catalyst you risk 3% instead of 2%. Determining the strength of trading signals and modifying percent risked is an advanced
technique and not recommended for beginners.

### Correlated Assets

Before trading you need to decide how to handle correlated assets. You need to have a plan for how you will detect if two
assets are correlated and how you will handle two correlated assets. Sooner or later your trading system will provide
trading signals for two correlated assets at the same time.

Considerations for correlated assets:

- How will you calculate correlation? (Recommended to use a calculator as discussed previously)
- What will your correlation cutoff be? (-0.5 to 0.5 is a good starting point)
- How will you trade two correlated assets? (Risk full percentage on one asset or split percent risked between the assets)

### Allowable Max Drawdown

Every strategy experiences drawdowns. Some strategies will experience many small drawdowns and some strategies will experience
a few very large drawdowns. You must analyze your backtesting results to see the average and max drawdowns your strategy
underwent. This will give you an idea of what to set your allowable max drawdown at. For example if your max drawdown during
testing was 17% maybe you set your allowable max drawdown at 20%. If your live strategy experiences a drawdown of 20% it is
a fair assumption that market conditions have changed and your strategy may no longer be effective.

### Position Size Tools

How will you calculate position size? You should not be using a calculator or pen and paper. You should either be using
an algorithm or an online calculator that you input values into. In the risk management chapter we discussed the recommended
online calculators and why they are necessary.

### Minimum Allowable Maintenance Margin (Or Margin Level if trading Forex)

If you are trading in a margin account you need to pay attention to your maintenance margin. Brokers require a certain amount
of account equity in comparison to how much you have borrowed. If you drop below this maintenance margin brokers can initiate a
margin call which you absolutely do not want.

You should set a minimum allowable maintenance margin well above your broker's maintenance margin. This will ensure that you
are safe from a margin call and ensure that you are not too exposed to the markets at once. If your broker has a maintenance
margin requirement of 30% maybe you set yours at 45%. Trades will frequently dip toward your stoploss before heading for your
takeprofit. This extra 15% buffer gives your open trades room to breathe.

Before opening a trade double check how it will impact maintenance margin. Ensure that it will not violate the minimum
allowable maintenance margin you have set.

Brokers have a variety of names for different margin metrics and have different requirements for each metric. Be sure to read
up on your broker's documentation to ensure that you understand everything correctly. For example forex brokers typically
use a metric called margin level. If this drops below 100% brokers usually do not allow you to open more trades.
