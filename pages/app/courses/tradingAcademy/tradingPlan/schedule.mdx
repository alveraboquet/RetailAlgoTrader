# Schedule

This last component is very straight-forward. As a trader there is no parent or boss to force you to do your job. It all comes
down to you. This requires immense discipline. Trading can be stressful. Filling out a trading journal is boring. Backtesting
is very tedious. Like any job there is a lot about trading that is not enjoyable.

Creating a schedule that dictates when you will perform what actions is vital. In addition to holding you accountable it can
also ensure you do not overtrade. Many people cannot trade correctly past 4 hours or so. They become tired and begin making
poor trading decisions. By defining when you can and cannot trade you ensure long-term productivity.

## Components of a Schedule

All schedules should include at a minimum the following:

- On what days will you trade?
- During what hours will you trade?
- When will you complete your trading journal?
- When will you analyze your trading journal?
- When will you work on developing new strategies?
